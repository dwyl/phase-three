# Goal [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues)


![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21752678/9f63432c-d5d4-11e6-84ad-4b2997d9bcb3.png)

## The goal is: to live in `nature` with our `loved ones`, `fresh air`, `water` & `sunshine`. A `safe`, `stimulating` and `sustainable` environment with `interesting` people. A `#HappyPlace` where we are `inspired`, `creative`, and `engaged` in `activities` that are `meaningful` to us.

(_if that sounds too "hippie-ish", then this repository/idea  
  is probably not going interest you, so ignore just it...!  
  but if you like it then :star: the repo & discuss the issues!!_)

## **Location**/**Land** ***Requirements*** for "`#HappyPlace`"

+ _Access to Abundant_ ***Water*** (_preferably from a spring_): https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/21
+ _Fertile_ ***Land***: https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/3 ***and/or*** https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/25
+ **Sunshine** (_a good annual average sunshine index both for vitamin D and Solar Power_): https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/26
+ **_Existing_ Trees** (for fresh air and habitat for wildlife): https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/6
+ Proximity to **Transport Network** (_ideally public transport e.g: rail/bus_)
+ No existing negative environmental factors (_e.g: pollution from nearby industry_)
+ Proximity to **Medical Services** (_ideally a full-service hospital; not just a medical outpost_)
+ Quietness/Tranquility (_this may be seen as "at odds" with "proximity" useful infrastructure, but it's a balance...!_)
+ (_Reasonable_) Proximity to Urban areas so we can _sell_ our fresh produce! (_one of our income streams_...)
+ Stable average temperature - "Not too hot" in the summer and "not too cold" in the winter (_snow is fine but not "minus 40"...!_)
mostly because as we _age_ extreme temperatures make bones ache!


## **Learning Center** Requirements

+ Quiet + Well-lit and temperature controlled rooms
  + Electricity (_for information technology learning_)
  + Wireless Internet

## "_Nice-to-Have_" List

+ Raised (Bed) Gardens (_waist height. to ensure everyone can interact with plants and/or grow their own food!_)
+ Swimming Pool for exercise purposes just above waist height & heated (indoor)
+ Exercise Coach (_at least twice a week_); MVP can be using Free YouTube Videos, but having a person present is better for participation
+ Handcrafts person (painting, embroidery, puzzle making ... mental/motor skills)
+ Free **golf cart** system so people are required to leave their house every day (_preferably this would be autonomous so anyone can use it regardless of ability/capacity to drive_)
+ Central/Accessible Multi-purpose "Community Area"
+ Rails everywhere; every pathway has a rail so people can walk.
+ Corridors should have a Good width (1.5m) to allow two wheelchairs to pass side-by-side.

### Family Retreat

+ Learning environment for all types of useful knowledge.
+ Healthy eating and learning to make food
+ Biological (_organic_) farming

### Other Services (_described as "really good to have"_):

+ Physiotherapist/chiropractor/shiatsu/massage-therapist to help people repair/recover their bodies.
+ Hair dresser (_for those who are lucky enough to still have hair!_)

> "**Loja da Av√≥**" - shop to help older people remain independent.


## Questions/Topics to Discuss (_in the issues!_):

+ All flat vs mountainous/terraced? It can be very difficult for [older people](https://youtu.be/0dsS6Znhw5M)
to walk hills, though we can have [_solar-powered_](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/7)
electric scooters/carts for the steeper bits,
and having an incline makes building terraced houses/growing a thing.
+ Should we allow/accommodate (_and encourage people to bring their_) pets?
