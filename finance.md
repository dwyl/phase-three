## Why?

Being "_bound_" to a **Job** in order to
earn enough ***money*** to _live_ (_pay rent/bills_)
is what keeps _most_ people from doing something
_meaninigful/fulfilling_ with their lives.

If you find yourself doing work you don't _love_
(_measured by how excited you are to go/get to work each day_!)
then _maybe_ we can help ...

## What?

Financial literacy in general and freedom _specifically_
is a not taught in school.
Some "_conspiracy theorists_" claim that this is a _deliberate_ attempt
to "_keep the masses ignorant_" so that the "_elites_" can continue
to dominate and live off the labour of the financially illiterate.

I _personally_ don't think there is any "_nafarious_" _reason_
that financial literacy is not taught in (_most_) schools;
there just isn't enough time to cover the _existing_ curriculum as it is!
Also, it doesn't _help_ that most teachers are "_wage slaves_"
(_apologies if that's "offensive" to anyone,
but it's an **accurate** description_)
so they don't know the _first_ thing about finance
so cannot _possibly_ teach it to their students!

## _How_?

There are two ways to achieve financial freedom:

1. ***Increase*** your (_positive_) **cashflow** to **_exceed_ expenses**.
2. ***Lower*** your **expenses** so you don't need as much income.

Let's address each of these in turn:

### 1. Increasing Cashflow

As an _individual_ in creasing your cashflow can be done in _several_ ways.

### 2. Lowering Expenses

Expenses are _usually_ the easiest thing to control for an _individual_,
but often people focus _too_ much on their expenses instead of
simply making more money ...


### Critical (_Personal_) Questions

There a few questions you have to ask/answer yourself:
+ Do I earn more than minimum wage?
+ Can I earn incremental income if I work more hours?
+ Can I pay someone else (_less than what I am paid_)
to do work I don't want to do?
