# The (dwyl) NetWork

A network of creative technology people engaged
in learning, fulfilling/innovative work
with a socially beneficial outcome.

## _Why_?

There is no shortage of "professional networks"
LinkedIn being the most prominent one.
On LinkedIn people _pay_ for "Premium"
which is $10/month and allows ...
> Please summarize the list of Premium "features". `help wanted`

LinkedIn could do a _whole_ lot more with the community,
but because they have steady revenues they have all but stopped innovating
(_we don't count occasional UI changes as "innovation"..._)

> _See below for "**The Problem with LinkedIn**"_

## _What_?

The Creative Technology Learning Community.
Connect and learn with people who are experienced/knowledgeable
in the field you are interested in.

### Content Will _Always_ Be Free

All _recorded_ content is (_and always will be_) free.
This is essential for ensuring ***accessibility***
to people who cannot (_yet_) afford to pay for learning.

>_The **last** thing we want is to create a "pay wall"
like FrontEnd Masters or TreeHouse
  which are **way** out of reach for unemployed
  people in low-income countries!_

Once people feel a bit more confident with their knowledge/skills,
and are getting _income_ from their chosen skill they will
naturally want to "_support the network_" with a _nominal_
payment. The payment will grant them _considerable_ additional value/benefit.

### Paid Value-Added Services (_Which Cost Money to Provide_)

+ Connect with fellow creative technology professionals
without fear of being spammed by recruiters.
+ Live-streams learning workshops and meetups.
+ Access to ask questions of the highly experienced/skilled people
delivering the workshop in real-time.
+ Request personal advice from industry insiders.
+ Get notified of potential work by NetWork Members.
+ Meet and interact with other creative people online and in-person.



## _Who_?

People who want to learn and do
creative technology work professionally.


# _How_?

## Membership

How does someone _become_ a member?
People can either _apply_ in which case they need to submit


## Membership Fees?

If we charge $10/month it might sound "_reasonable_"
to most people in G20 ("_developed_") countries where average earnings are
comparatively _high_ by international standards.
But if your _income_ is $100/month (_e.g: in Manila or Mobassa)
then $10 is prohibitively expensive
(_even if you get a 10x the value of the membership fee it's still a lot
in the beginning for someone on a lower income..!_)

### 1% of Minimum Wage?

> _**1% of National Minimum Wage** for the country you are based in_.

If **Minimum Wage** is **€650**/month (_e.g. Portugal_)
then your membership fee is €6.50/month.

On reflection this is a pretty good deal given what's included.

### Free Tier?

We think _everyone_ should be able to benefit
from the _content_ (_learning materials_)
regardless of their ability to pay.
But to avoid "_spam_" and "_noise_"
the "real-time" community features should be invite-only and paid.

## tl;dr

I used to be _very_ active on LinkedIn in the _early_ days.
I saw it as a great way to stay in touch with people I knew
and/or had worked with professionally.
I considered it to be the best "online CV".
We used to joke "Jenny just updated her LinkedIn,
she must be getting ready to move jobs".
As soon as the HR/Recruiter people started _actively_ using it,
they spoiled it.


### The Problem with LinkedIn

The _problem_ with LinkedIn is: _recruiters_!
LinkedIn started out as a professional network,
but rapidly became a tool for recruiters to "_source_" talented people.
If you are _any_ good at what you do and you make it known on LinkedIn
you will get a _flood_ of unsolicited messages, emails and phone calls!
And if you happen to _connect_ with a recruiter, they will _spam_ all
_your_ connections! :sad:

### Recruiters

_Most_ recruiters are ***sales people*** without any _real_ skills
other than persuasion techniques and sales tactics.

Their job is to fill positions as quickly as possible
in order to maximize their commission.
Recruiters are _seldom_ paid on
