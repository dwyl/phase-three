# The Plan [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues)


## Why?

### “_If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!_” ~ <small>Benjamin Franklin</small>


## What?

If you've been around here for a while, you may have noticed that dwyl does many things:
we build open source [apps](https://github.com/dwyl/time), websites and [modules](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2),
we build them for ourselves and for clients, we write tutorials, promote open source,
provide technology training, get involved in accessibility and women in tech initiatives.

It didn't start out like this.

We began with [a product MVP](https://github.com/dwyl/time),
then in order to support [Founders & Coders](foundersandcoders.com) and ensure the lights
could be kept on at this organisation that dwyl's co-founders were heavily involved
in building, we [started to take on client projects](https://github.com/dwyl/ateam-proposal)(again)
whilst building our learning community by sharing the knowledge as we went.

This plan lays out **how dwyl aims to achieve its goals**, _clarifying_ the many hats
dwyl wears and how they _work together_.

## Contents Guide
For the time being, we are putting everything into this one .md file, to be split
out once reviewed from its rough draft form. We'll need a way to navigate!

## Context
2017 is the year of **formalising the various types of work we do into their
own, neat groupings of activities**, which for now we'll call 'verticals' (but that's
awful and we need a better word!).

> Each vertical will have it's own mission, detailed goals and timelines,
feeding directly into dwyl's overall goal.

dwylers will work within one vertical for at least 50% of their time, but _will
contribute to more than one_ depending on personal preferences and dwyl's needs.
For example, a developer working mostly on product could spend some time doing QA
on a _services_ project and also film a introductory video tutorial for a new technology they've learned.

## Verticals
All verticals **must contribute to our fixed overheads** (aside from Product
which we will need to invest in in the short term) and/or contribute to our
credibility as experts in a given field.

Each vertical will have **its own set of goals**, derived from [dwyl's guiding principles](github.com/dwyl/phase-two#guiding-principles)
which will be refined over time to serve as it's _decision making framework_.

> There is overlap across all of our verticals - they all present multiple opportunities to feed into each other.

### Product

#### Why?
When we first started dwyl in April 2015, our intention has always been to be a 'products company'. Why? For so many reasons!

The most significant for us are:
+ Being people-centred has always been at the core of our philosophies and
working on products that **solve real problems** and that we believe in are the best way to reach the *most* people
  + Working with different clients has [exposed us to problems](https://github.com/SafeLives) that we may never have delved into ourselves
  but has also limited our reach
+ To follow the process from an idea to scale without constraint
+ To create something that goes far beyond the linear limitations of how much
time we can put into a project
+ To scratch our own itch, building tools that make *our* lives easier and more
effective as an organisation but may not already exist

#### Goals
Initially centred on:
+ Date for MVP
+ Number of _active_ users by the end of the calendar year (based on repeated interaction with the app, [not time spent on it](https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/149#issuecomment-269154087))
+ Break-even date
+ Targets on quantitative feedback from people using the application

#### What?
Our first products will be [time](github.com/dwyl/time) (name TBC!) and [tudo](github.com/dwyl/tudo).
Built with a modular architecture, this application will be a cross between a
to-do list and a time tracking application.
+ Still love the strapline: 'Getting through your must-dos to get to your want-tos', though I'm not sure this accurately reflects the aims anymore
+ Key aims:
  + Effective time management (understand where it is going & how to improve)
  + Improved team communication
  + Improved focussed time
  + Deliver work
+ Focus on the individual's potential/productivity first
+ Ability to share with the team built in from the beginning so people know
 when they would be interrupting ("I'm on fire" one-click warning to others
:wink:) - key is to do a lot of research around what people _want_ to share
 and what they want to be shared _with them_
 + Minimum friction wherever possible, e.g. one-click start of timers,
 recognition of a github URL & data filled in automatically
 + We want our products to benefit from a positive [network effect](https://medium.com/evergreen-business-weekly/the-power-of-network-effects-why-they-make-such-valuable-companies-and-how-to-harness-them-5d3fbc3659f8#.6w6z2hjew) where increased usage of the product leads to it being a more valuable product for everyone (plays into open source)

+ CRM - so many thoughts to write out on this

There are many 'small' enhancements we will be making to increase the effectiveness
of our own workflow. Each should be evaluated as a potential product.


### Services
+ Split into two sections: consulting and development
  + Consulting again split in two:
    + Identification and solution of problems
    + Effective implementation and use (including user testing)
    of our products for organisations
+ _Everything_ we build must have a social impact or reusable open source components
+ Focus:
  + Delighting our existing clients
  + Building sales & running of projects into _extremely solid_ processes that
  can be scaleable with a relatively small amount of support
    + Freelance model will be required whilst we build our pipeline and
    solidify our processes
      + Product will need a **strong foundation** before we can have people
      jumping around between services and product or it'll be too difficult to
      manage and the switching costs will unavoidably drain funds
+ One of our strongest channels for reaching many different organisations
  and helping them learn about dwyl

#### Goals
Initially centred on:
+ Social impact metric of some description
+ Cost of new client acquisition
+ Net promoter score (NPS)

### Training
+ Workshops
  + HTML/CSS for designers
  + New stack (Phoenix)
  + User testing
  + Testing
  + Agile development
+ Building content around our business
+ Focus on video tutorials
  + Purpose of this is multi-fold: establish a new channel of learning for our
  community (especially for visual learners), continue to enhance our
  reputation for educating and creating in-bound links
  + We use our own products as the subject of our beginner videos (I'm particularly excited about the user testing one)

### Co-working

More to come, but these are the most immediate!
