# The Plan [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues)


## Why?

### “_If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!_” ~ <small>Benjamin Franklin</small>


## What?

If you've been around here for a while, you may have noticed that dwyl does many things:
we build open source [apps](https://github.com/dwyl/time), websites and [modules](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2),
we build them for ourselves and for clients, we write tutorials, promote open source,
provide technology training, get involved in accessibility and women in tech initiatives.

It didn't start out like this.

We began with [a product MVP](https://github.com/dwyl/time),
then in order to support [Founders & Coders](foundersandcoders.com) and ensure the lights
could be kept on at this organisation that dwyl's co-founders were heavily involved
in building, we [started to take on client projects](https://github.com/dwyl/ateam-proposal)(again)
whilst building our learning community by sharing the knowledge as we went.

This plan lays out how dwyl aims to achieve its goals, clarifying the many hats
dwyl wears and how they work together.
