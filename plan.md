# The Plan [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues)


## Why?

### “_If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!_” ~ <small>Benjamin Franklin</small>


## What?

If you've been around here for a while, you may have noticed that dwyl does many things:
we build open source [apps](https://github.com/dwyl/time), websites and [modules](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2),
we build them for ourselves and for clients, we write tutorials, promote open source,
provide technology training, get involved in accessibility and women in tech initiatives.

It didn't start out like this.

We began with [a product MVP](https://github.com/dwyl/time),
then in order to support [Founders & Coders](foundersandcoders.com) and ensure the lights
could be kept on at this organisation that dwyl's co-founders were heavily involved
in building, we [started to take on client projects](https://github.com/dwyl/ateam-proposal)(again)
whilst building our learning community by sharing the knowledge as we went.

This plan lays out **how dwyl aims to achieve its goals**, _clarifying_ the many hats
dwyl wears and how they _work together_.

## Contents Guide
For the time being, we are putting everything into this one .md file, to be split
out once reviewed from its rough draft form. We'll need a way to navigate!

## Context
Since April 2015, we have been running dwyl with two people at the 'helm' (setting
the direction of the organisation) with an [awesome team](http://www.dwyl.io) and community
contributing to everything we do.

2017 is the year of **formalising the various types of work we do into their
own, neat groupings of activities**, which for now we'll call 'verticals' (but that's
awful and we need a better word!).

> Each vertical will have it's own mission, detailed goals and timelines,
feeding directly into dwyl's overall goal.

dwylers will work within one vertical for at least 50% of their time, but _will
contribute to more than one_ depending on personal preferences and dwyl's needs.
For example, a developer working mostly on product could spend some time doing QA
on a _services_ project and also film a introductory video tutorial for a new technology they've learned.

## Verticals

### Product

### Services

### Training

### Co-working

More to come, but these are the most immediate!
