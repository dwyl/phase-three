## Why?

Being "_bound_" to a **Job** in order to
earn enough ***money*** to _live_ (_pay rent/bills_)
is what keeps _most_ people from doing something
_meaninigful/fulfilling_ with their lives.

If you find yourself doing work you don't _love_
(_measured by how excited you are to go/get to work each day_!)
then _maybe_ we can help ...

## What?

Financial literacy in general and freedom _specifically_
is a not taught in school.
Some "_conspiracy theorists_" claim that this is a _deliberate_ attempt
to "_keep the masses ignorant_" so that the "_elites_" can continue
to dominate and live off the labour of the financially illiterate.

I _personally_ don't think there is any "_nafarious_" _reason_
that financial literacy is not taught in (_most_) schools;
there just isn't enough time to cover the _existing_ curriculum as it is!

## _How_?

There are two ways to achieve financial freedom:

1. ***Increase*** your (_positive_) **cashflow** to **_exceed_ expenses**.
2. ***Lower*** your **expenses** so you don't need as much income.

Let's address each of these in turn:

### 1. Increasing Cashflow

As an _individual_


### 1. Lowering Expenses
