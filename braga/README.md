## Why?

One of the ***biggest*** "***challenges***" we faced in **London**
with **Founders & Coders** was finding ***premises***. <br />
We have been paying (_burning money on_) "_commercial rates_"
**£3600/month** including "business rates" for **140m<sup>2</sup>** <br />
@ **14 Palmers Road** for the past 27 months.
see:
[Fixed Overhead Breakdown](https://github.com/dwyl/quietspace/tree/58eb654e522b9974c1f83f12b5e79925d0132f3b#fixed-overheads-costs-we-have-to-cover) <br />
> The amount we pay for 14 Palmers Road is actually _quite reasonable_
for London commercial property _especially_<br />
 when compared to a _desk space_
at "WeWork" or "SecondHome" start at £350/month for **4m<sup>2</sup>** of space!

Even if (_when_) Founders & Coders (London) _eventually_ gets "_free_"
premises based on its' charitable status everyone _attending_ will
still need to pay London rents, transport and living expenses.

### Cost of Living in London

The rent for premises in London is the tip of the cost iceberg!
By _far_ the biggest "_space_" cost is the ***cumulative rent***
all the people _attending_ Founders & Coders pay.
The average **rent** for a _room_ in London
is **£600/month** (_including bills_),
for those who use _public transport_
a **travel pass** costs a ***minimum*** of
[**£100/month**](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/adult-fares-2017.pdf)
If people eat _frugally_ by prepare meals in bulk
and limit alcohol intake / eating out
they can survive on £4/day for **food** so ***£150/month***.

The _bare minimum_ total for living in London is ***£750/month***. <br />
This does not factor the wasted _time_ people have commuting
to-from mile end each day (_average 1.5h each day!_)

### Saving _Everyone_ Time and Money so they can dwyl

By setting up **Braga House** we can cut down on London living expenses
by ***Two Thirds*** and give everyone more time to learn, create and live!




## What?

### Creative Technology Rapid Learning Workspace (`CTRL+W`)

`CTRL+W` is a **hub** for creative technology learning and sustainable living.

Braga is not (_yet_) on the "Digital Map" the way Lisbon or Porto are.
There are _several_ factors that make it a good candidate:
+ General availability of high-speed internet
+ Considerably cheaper living costs and far less crowded
than bigger European cities; fewer tourists means great food is still cheap!
+ All major supermarkets, clothing stores and facilities are available
+ Good (_modern_) hospital and other medical
facilities e.g: dentists and eye specialists (_we recently updated our glasses
  and paid around a third of London prices! so much for "specsavers"!_)
+ Comparitively high education levels and low crime rate
+ Excellent transport links (_Buses/Trains to the rest of Portugal_)
  > _Direct_ Bus to Porto Airport is **€8** and takes **50 mins**
  via [GetBus](http://www.getbus.eu)
+ Considerably better **Air Quality** than any major European City
+ Parks, Out-door Gyms, Mountain Biking Trails

# How?


## The House (_of dwyl?_ ;-)

The house is comprised of 3 floors:
+ **Basement**
  + Large Garage with street door and ramp to the public road - we will
  be using the garage as our multi-purpose indoor communal/community area.
    + Projector
    + Beanbags
    + Yoga Mats
  + 2 Medium Sized ("double") rooms:
    + **Multi-media recording/editing studio** for video/podcast production
    + "**Art Room**" for design, crafts & other arts.
  + 1 Small ("single") room (_was previously used as a study_)
    we intend to use this as our Laundry, utilities and linen room.
  + Bathroom w/ Shower (_big enough for an accessible/wheelchair facility
    or multiple showers_)
+ **First Floor**
  + Extra-Large Living room (9.4 x 4.3m) - to be used as our main co-working
  space. It can easily fit desks for 20 people (1m wide - see below)
  + Dining Room fits 8 People
  + Kitchen (large enough for double appliances and "American" fridges)
  + Walk-in Pantry perfect for storing food and kitchen appliances.
  + Office/Study - this will be our library and resource room (_printing etc_)
  + Bathroom
+ **Second Floor**
  + 4 Large bedrooms - the plan is to use these 3 large rooms as "Dorm" rooms
    with bunk beds. Each room can comfortably fit 5 bunk beds with
    storage space, however we are going to _initially_ limit each room to 4
    (_double_) bunks (_see below for details_)
  + 1 Medium bedroom this will be the bedroom for Ines & Nelson
  or who ever is the "_house master_" once it's set up
  and ready to run _independently_ of us.
  + Bathroom w/ shower - this will be converted into 2 individual showers.
  + Bathroom w/ bath - this will be converted into additional toilet cubicles.
+ **Outdoors / Garden**
  + 2.5 - 4m around the house (_currently the garden is very neglected
    so requires some attention/landscaping_) we are considering the following:
    + Outdoor table Tennis (_covered_)
    + Outdoor Table Football ("_fussball_")
    + Hot tub (_we need to gauge demand for it
      and cost it including annual maintenance_)
  + Bird House (_disused_) - the plan is to convert it into something _useful_
  like a sauna/steam room (_which is great for detox/letting off steam..._)
  + Glass Cube for outdoor meditation, quiet reading and isolated creative work.

## 1. A House for _Creative Technologists_

The Braga House is a place for people to live, learn & work
with _Creative Technologies_.




Our plan is to create a _haven_
for people who are _already_
"***Digital Nomads***" and/or those who _want_
to _learn_ how to be ***Creative Technologists***.

Initially the house will be "_invite-only_"
(_for reasons we will expand on below_)
but once we are up-and-running
we will have an ***application process*** for people joining.


### What is a _Creative Technologist_ ?





### What is a "Digital Nomad" ("_DiNo_")?

A "Digital Nomad" (_or_ "_DiNo_" _for short_)
is a person who is "***location-independent***".
A DiNo's does not require visiting a traditional "_office_".
They can ***work from anywhere***
with nothing more than a **Laptop Computer & Internet Connection**.

Much of the "**Knowledge Economy**" work can be done _remotely_.
This lowers the costs to the person doing the work
because they don't have to pay _exhorbitant_ "_Metropolis_" rents/prices
(_e.g. London, New York, San Jose, Oslo, Tokyo, etc._)

We @dwyl have _embraced_ remote working from the beginning because we know
that as long as people have a quiet place to focus on their work,
it can be done from _anywhere_.

Quite a few (_existing_) dwyl team members have worked remotely over the past
couple of years from interesting places such as Bali, Japan, Mexico, Columbia,
Spain, France, Scotland, Portugal, USA, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand, etc
(_the list goes on!_).
But until now we haven't been able to _provide_ the destination for people
to go and live & work remotely.
And while "Braga" might not be a "beach in Thailand" it does have
certain _other_ advantages (detailed below) which will
make it attractive to DiNos.



### How Many Beds?

There is space for 48 beds (24 Bunks) in the house if we were to _maximise_ it,
but our purpose is to make it _comfortable_ for everyone
so our plan is to `limit` it to **32 bunk beds** (16 bunks);
4 bunks per large room.


### A Well-Defined Weekly Schedule

We have tried "_self-organising_" (_AKA "chaos"_)
and while the _end result_

### Lights Out Sleep Time: 22:00

No more tech after Ten PM.
We expect people to sleep from 23:00 - 07:00 (8hrs)
Some of us will sleep 22:00 - 05:00 because we need to be up early to
go to the fruit+veg market.

### Weekends

Everyone is free to relax and do what they want on weekends.
People who observe a specific faith should make this known
to others after joining so everyone `else` can respect
their days/times of worship.


### Hostel Requirements and Considerations

+ Firstly we need to _enquire_ about ***licensing/regulations***
to operate a "Bed and Breakfast" or "Youth Hostel"
in the area and specifically that location.
+ **Solar panels** - what is the pay-back period (_financial_)
and can we _justify_ investing in panels immediately?
(_can we use the bank loan to finance them_?)
+ **_Secure_ bicycle parking**. (_off street_) - how many spaces?
+ **_Secure_ Building Access** membership card and/or NFC-enabled mobile phone.
  all exterior doors will have security cameras for the safety of members.
+ **Bunk Beds** - are there already _great_ quality beds we can use
or do we need to spec/design and order our own from scratch.
+ Investigate fresh produce (_wholesale_) market for sourcing fruit & veg
with a bulk discount.
+ Should we make all fruit & veg "free" for members?
+ A clear code-of-conduct must be drawn up using dwyl's existing one.
It _must_ be _clear_ to all what constitutes acceptable behaviour
and what the grounds are for membership (_and the revocation thereof_)
e.g: knowingly breaking any local law will lead to membership termination
because each member is an ambassador/representative of the entire org/team.


## 2. Workspace

Our plan is to create _ideal_ ("***deep***") working conditions
for the **24 people** staying with us.

Considering that we currently have 26+ people
working in the **140m**<sup>2</sup> at Palmer's road,
we expect people to be a **lot more _comfortable_**
with **300m**<sup>2</sup>.

People will be able to work their choice of creative/technology projects.
We will give preferential residence/access to people who work with/for dwyl.




### Desks

We will make **24 sit/stand desks** available for people to use.
The desks will be primarily in the "**Main Office**"
which will have **20 desks**.

### Dimensions

Each desk will measure 100 x 70cm
(_this is **compact** but **comfortable** for a Laptop,
  Gas-lift mounted Screen, notepad and other personal afects_)

### Sit/Stand

Desks can be  have a vertical range of between 65cm and 125cm
(_this **exceeds** the range of motion of an IKEA Bekant sit/stand desk_)

Desks will be on castors and can be moved into different layouts.
We can easily switch between
"classroom" format (_everyone facing the projector screen_)
and "deep work" (_everyone facing the walls to avoid distraction_)
or "team work" (_where desks are clustered to promote collaboration_).


### Well-defined Work Day: 08:00 - 16:00

We will _encourage_ people to work have _consistent_ working hours
from 08:00 - 16:00. The "Main Room" is available for
co-working during these hours.
 people should take a break for lunch,
go for a walks (_outside_) and take naps (_upstairs_) as required.

If people prefer to work earlier or later than this
that is fine! We will simply ask that they do so from a _different_ room.

### Day Visitors

Once we are _well established_ we will encourage other people
to visit during the day to learn & collaborate with us.

The "main room" will be reserved for focussed work
as visitors will inevitably distract others.

Similar to "Google Campus" where _anyone_ can show up and work.
People who are _members_ of dwyl can come and work in the house/gardens
and use free WiFi.

### No Working in the Kitchen Dining Room

No laptops are allowed in the Kitchen/Dining room;
these are areas for eating and casual conversations, not staring at screens.

Tablets/phones are permitted to _demo_ work
as part of informal discussions
and for checking recipes in the kitchen
but people should not sit at the table messaging or watching videos.


## 3. Creative Technology Resource & Learning Workshops (`CTRL+W`)

The purpose of `CTRL+W` is to develop and share creative/technology knowledge.

Between **16:00 - 19:00** we will hold _**daily**
Creative Technology **Workshops** for **dwyl members**_.

We intend to share our learning _material_ both in written form
(_the way we have since the start of dwyl_) and as video recordings.

dwyl's purpose is _not_ to "_make money_" from education,
however we feel that the learning materials, online and in-person community
of creative technology professionals offers _significant_ value to our members.
In order to make Learning/Training a _sustainable independent_ "_arm_"
of dwyl we need to charge a _small_ monthly membership fee.

# The Plan

Hopefully the above has given some insight into what we intend to
do with the Braga House. (_if you have questions, please ask in issues(s)_!)

## Financials

### The House

Buying the house will cost **€280k** (_+ Taxes TBD_). <br />
This figure may sound like a "_bargain_" by "_big city_" standards ...
a **7 bedroom**, 3 bathroom, 2 office/study house with a generous kitchen,
separate dining room, a garden and garage for
_**less than** a **studio flat** in **London**_!

> We think this is an "_unmissable_" opportunity because the total cost
of living is less than **1/3** of **London** which means
that _all_ our members can achieve "***financial freedom***" much earlier!

### Renovations

_One_ of the reasons why the house is so "_cheap_" is that it requires a _lot_ of renovation ... it's been _empty_ for the past 2 years and needs
quite a lot of work to be "_nice_" again).

The total projected renovation cost is €230k including project management.
Please see spreadsheet for complete breakdown.
> _insert screenshots from spreadsheet_

### Monthly Running Costs

We estimate total monthly running costs of €2,000
Please see spreadsheet for detailed breakdown.
> _insert screenshots from spreadsheet_

### Revenue

For the purposes of this plan we are assuming that "The Braga House"
is a independent entity with a single source of Revenue.

In reality the revenue will be higher because we expect to have
membership of 200+ people  @ €6/month in Braga who will
attend Weekend Creative/Technology Workshops.

The "dwyl network" membership will cost €6/month if we have 200 members.



<br /><br />

The purpose of Braga is ***not*** to _live_ in Braga "_for ever_"
in the same way that the purposes of **MDC** was to live in SE5 for _ever_!
