> I don't know if this is the "_right_" place/repository
to include this idea/plan, so please feel free to _move it_
to somewhere more appropriate. (_I won't be offended!_)

## Why?

Sometimes in life we make decisions
that _may_ not appear _completely_ logical on the _surface_
but which turn out to be "_enlightened_"

## What?

A center for creative technology learning and sustainable living.

# How?



## The House

The house is comprised of 3 floors:
+ **Basement**
  + Large (4 car) Garage with street door and ramp to the public road - we will
  be using the garage as our multi-purpose in-door communal area.
    + Projector
    + Beanbags
    + Yoga Mats
  + 2 Medium Sized ("double") rooms
    + Multi-media recording studio for video/podcast production
    + Laundry, utilities and storage room
  + 1 Small ("single") room (_was previously used as a study_)
    Laundry, utilities and storage room.
  + Bathroom w/ Shower (_big enough for an accessible/wheelchair or multiple showers_)
+ **First Floor**
  + Extra-Large Living room (8 x 4m) - this will be used as our main co-working
  space. It can easily fit desks for
  + Dining Room fits 8 People
  + Kitchen (large enough for double appliances and "American" fridges)
  + Office/Study - this will be our library and resource room (_printing etc_)
  + Bathroom
+ **Second Floor**
  + 3 Large bedrooms - the plan is to use these 3 large rooms as "Dorm" rooms
    with bunk beds. Each room can comfortably fit 5 bunk beds with
    storage space, however we are going to _initially_ limit each room to 4
    (_double_) bunks (_see below for details_)
  + 1 Medium bedroom (_was used as a "TV Room"_)
  this will be the bedroom for Ines & Nelson
  or who ever is the "_house master_" once it's set up
  and ready to run _independently_ of us.
  + Bathroom w/ bath - this will be converted into 3 individual showers.
+ **Outdoors / Garden**
  + 2.5 - 4m around the house (_currently the garden is neglected
    so requires some attention_)
    + Out-door table Tennis (_covered_)
    + Out-door Table Football ("_fuseball_")
  + Bird House (_disused_) - the plan is to convert it into something useful
  like a sauna/steam room (_which is great for detox_)

## Hostel

Our plan is to create a _haven_ for
Digital Nomads and Tech Creative/Curious People

Initially the hostel will be "_invite-only_"
but once we are up-and-running
we will have an _application_ process for people joining.

### What is a "Digital Nomad"?

People who are location-independent and can work from anywhere.

### How Many Beds?

There is space up-to 48 beds if we were to _maximise_,
but our purpose is to make it _comfortable_ for everyone.



## Workspace

Our plan is to have 24 sit/stand desks.
Each desk will measure 100 x 70cm


## Creative Technology Learning Center





The purpose of Braga is not to _live_ in Braga "_for ever_"
in the same way that the purposes of MDC was to live in SE5 for ever.
