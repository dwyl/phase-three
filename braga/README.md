## Why?

Sometimes in life we make decisions
that _may_ not appear _completely_ logical on the _surface_
but which turn out to be _exceptionally_ "_enlightened_" in retrospect.

## What?

### Creative Technology Resource & Learning Workspace (`CTRL+W`)

`CTRL+W` is a **hub** for creative technology learning and sustainable living.

Braga is not (_yet_) on the "Digital Map" the way Lisbon or Porto are.
There are _several_ factors that make it a good candidate:
+ General availability of high-speed internet.
+ Considerably cheaper living costs and far less crowded
than bigger European cities; fewer tourists means great food is still cheap!
+ All major super markets, clothing stores and facilities are available.
+ Good (_modern_) hospital and other medical
facilities e.g: dentists and eye specialists (_we recently updated our glasses
  and paid around a third of London prices! so much for "specsavers"!_)
+ Generally high education levels and low crime rate.
+ Excellent transport links (_Bus/Train to the rest of Portugal_)
  > To investigate: is there a _direct_ bus to Porto Airport?


# How?


## The House (_of dwyl?_ ;-)

The house is comprised of 3 floors:
+ **Basement**
  + Large (4 car) Garage with street door and ramp to the public road - we will
  be using the garage as our multi-purpose in-door communal/community area.
    + Projector
    + Beanbags
    + Yoga Mats
  + 2 Medium Sized ("double") rooms:
    + **Multi-media recording/editing studio** for video/podcast production
    + "**Art Room**" for design, crafts & other arts.
  + 1 Small ("single") room (_was previously used as a study_)
    we intend to use this as our Laundry, utilities and linen room.
  + Bathroom w/ Shower (_big enough for an accessible/wheelchair facility
    or multiple showers_)
+ **First Floor**
  + Extra-Large Living room (8 x 4m) - to be used as our main co-working
  space. It can easily fit desks for
  + Dining Room fits 8 People
  + Kitchen (large enough for double appliances and "American" fridges)
  + Walk-in Pantry perfect for storing food and kitchen appliances.
  + Office/Study - this will be our library and resource room (_printing etc_)
  + Bathroom
+ **Second Floor**
  + 3 Large bedrooms - the plan is to use these 3 large rooms as "Dorm" rooms
    with bunk beds. Each room can comfortably fit 5 bunk beds with
    storage space, however we are going to _initially_ limit each room to 4
    (_double_) bunks (_see below for details_)
  + 1 Medium bedroom (_was used as a "TV Room"_)
  this will be the bedroom for Ines & Nelson
  or who ever is the "_house master_" once it's set up
  and ready to run _independently_ of us.
  + Bathroom w/ bath - this will be converted into 3 individual showers.
+ **Outdoors / Garden**
  + 2.5 - 4m around the house (_currently the garden is neglected
    so requires some attention/landscaping_) we are considering the following:
    + Out-door table Tennis (_covered_)
    + Out-door Table Football ("_fuseball_")
    + Hot tub (_we need to gauge demand for it
      and cost it including annual maintenance_)
  + Bird House (_disused_) - the plan is to convert it into something _useful_
  like a sauna/steam room (_which is great for detox/letting off steam..._)
  + Glass Cube for outdoor meditation, reading and isolated creative work.

## 1. Hostel

Our plan is to create a _haven_
for people who are _already_
"Digital Nomads" and/or those who _want_
to _learn_ how to be tech/creative innovators.

Initially the hostel will be "_invite-only_"
(_for reasons we will expand on below_)
but once we are up-and-running
we will have an ***application process*** for people joining.


### What is a "Digital Nomad" ("_DiNo_")?

A "Digital Nomad" (_or_ "_DiNo_" _for short_)
is a person who is "***location-independent***".
A DiNo's does not require visiting a traditional "_office_"
they can ***work from anywhere***
with nothing more than a **Laptop Computer & Internet Connection**.

Much of the "**Knowledge Economy**" work can be done _remotely_.
This lowers the costs to the person doing the work
because they don't have to pay _exorbitant_ "_Metropolis_" rents/prices
(_e.g. London, New York, San Jose, Oslo, Tokyo, etc._)

We @dwyl have _embraced_ remote working from the beginning because we know
that as long as people have a quite place to focus on their work,
it can be done from _anywhere_.

Quite a few (_existing_) dwyl team members have worked remotely over the past
couple of years from interesting places such as Bali, Japan, Mexico, Columbia,
Spain, France, Scotland, Portugal, USA, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand etc
(_the list goes on!_).
But until now we haven't been able to _provide_ the destination for people
to go and live & work remotely.
And while "Braga" might not be a "beach in Thailand" it does have
certain _other_ advantages which are detailed below which will
make it attractive to DiNos.


### How Many Beds?

There is space for 48 beds (24 Bunks) in the house if we were to _maximise_ it,
but our purpose is to make it _comfortable_ for everyone
so our plan is to `limit` it to **24 bunk beds** (12 bunks);
4 bunks per large room.


### Lights Out Sleep Time: 22:00

No more tech after Ten PM.
We expect people to sleep from 23:00 - 07:00 (8hrs)
Some of us will sleep 22:00 - 05:00 because we need to be up early to
go to the fruit+veg market.


### Hostel Requirements and Considerations

+ Firstly we need to _enquire_ about ***licensing/regulations***
to operate a "Bed and Breakfast" or "Youth Hostel"
in the area and specifically that location.
+ **Solar panels** - what is the pay-back period (_financial_)
and can we _justify_ investing in panels immediately?
(_can we use the bank loan to finance them_?)
+ **_Secure_ bicycle parking**. (_off street_) - how many spaces?
+ **_Secure_ Building Access** membership card and/or NFC-enabled mobile phone.
  all exterior doors will have security cameras for the safety of members.
+ **Bunk Beds** - are there already _great_ quality beds we can use
or do we need to spec/design and order our own from scratch.
+ Investigate fruit & veg (_wholesale_) market



## 2. Workspace

Our plan is to create _ideal_ ("***deep***") working conditions
for the **24 people** staying with us.

Considering that we currently have 26+ people
working in the **140m**<sup>2</sup> at Palmer's road,
we expect people to be a **lot more _comfortable_**
with **300m**<sup>2</sup>

### Desks

We will make **24 sit/stand desks** available for people to use.
The desks will be primarily in the "Main Office" which will have 18 desks.
Each desk will measure 100 x 70cm
and have a vertical range of between 65cm and 125cm
(_this **exceeds** the range of motion of an IKEA Bekant sit/stand desk_)


### Well-defined Work Day: 08:00 - 16:00

We will _encourage_ people to work have _consistent_ working hours
from 08:00 - 16:00. The "Main Room" is available for
co-working during these hours.
 people should take a break for lunch,
go for a walks (_outside_) and take naps (_upstairs_) as required.

If people prefer to work earlier or later than this
that is fine! We will simply ask that they do so from a _different_ room

### No Working in the Kitchen Dining Room

No laptops are allowed in the Kitchen/Dining room;
these are areas for conversations not "_anti-social_" working.

Tablets/phones are permitted to _demo_ work as part of discussions
and for checking recipes in the kitchen.

### Day Visitors

Once we are _well established_ we will encourage other people
to visit during the day to learn & collaborate with us.

Similar to "Google Campus" where _anyone_ can show up and work.
People who are _members_ of dwyl can come and work in the house/gardens
and use free WiFi

## 3. Creative Technology Resource & Learning Workshops (`CTRL+W`)

The purpose of `CTRL+W` is to develop and share creative/technology knowledge.

Between **16:00 - 19:00** we will hold _**daily**
Creative Technology **Workshops** for **dwyl members**_.

We intend to share our learning _material_ both in written form
(_the way we have since the start of dwyl_) and as video recordings.

dwyl's purpose is _not_ to "_make money_" from education,
however we feel that the learning materials, online and in-person community
of creative technology professionals offers _significant_ value to our members.
In order to make Learning/Training a _sustainable independent_ "_arm_"
of dwyl we need to charge a _small_ monthly membership fee.

We will maintain ***100% Transparency*** in the "dwyl NetWork"
it will be _clear_ to all members _exactly_ where their membership fee
is being spent (_mostly content creation, infrastructure/servers and admin_).




The purpose of Braga is ***not*** to _live_ in Braga "_for ever_"
in the same way that the purposes of **MDC** was to live in SE5 for _ever_!
