> I don't know if this is the "_right_" place/repository
to include this idea/plan, so please feel free to _move it_
to somewhere more appropriate. (_I won't be offended!_)

## Why?

Sometimes in life we make decisions
that _may_ not appear _completely_ logical on the _surface_
but which turn out to be _exceptionally_ "_enlightened_" in retrospect.

## What?

A center for learning, creative technology and sustainable living.

Braga is not (_yet_) on the "Digital Map" the way Lisbon or Porto are.
There are _several_ factors that make it a good candidate:
+ General availability of high-speed internet.
+ Considerably cheaper living costs and far less crowded
than bigger European cities; fewer tourists means great food is still cheap!
+ All major super markets, clothing stores and facilities are available.
+ Good (_modern_) hospital and other medical
facilities e.g: dentists and eye specialists (_we recently updated our glasses
  and paid around a third of London prices! so much for "specsavers"!_)
+ Generally high eduction levels and low crime rate.
+ Excellent transport links (_Bus/Train to the rest of Portugal_)
  > To investigate: is there a _direct_ bus to Porto Airport?

# How?


## The House (_of dwyl?_ ;-)

The house is comprised of 3 floors:
+ **Basement**
  + Large (4 car) Garage with street door and ramp to the public road - we will
  be using the garage as our multi-purpose in-door communal/community area.
    + Projector
    + Beanbags
    + Yoga Mats
  + 2 Medium Sized ("double") rooms
    + Multi-media recording/editing studio for video/podcast production
    + Laundry, utilities and storage room
  + 1 Small ("single") room (_was previously used as a study_)
    Laundry, utilities and storage room.
  + Bathroom w/ Shower (_big enough for an accessible/wheelchair facility
    or multiple showers_)
+ **First Floor**
  + Extra-Large Living room (8 x 4m) - to be used as our main co-working
  space. It can easily fit desks for
  + Dining Room fits 8 People
  + Kitchen (large enough for double appliances and "American" fridges)
  + Office/Study - this will be our library and resource room (_printing etc_)
  + Bathroom
+ **Second Floor**
  + 3 Large bedrooms - the plan is to use these 3 large rooms as "Dorm" rooms
    with bunk beds. Each room can comfortably fit 5 bunk beds with
    storage space, however we are going to _initially_ limit each room to 4
    (_double_) bunks (_see below for details_)
  + 1 Medium bedroom (_was used as a "TV Room"_)
  this will be the bedroom for Ines & Nelson
  or who ever is the "_house master_" once it's set up
  and ready to run _independently_ of us.
  + Bathroom w/ bath - this will be converted into 3 individual showers.
+ **Outdoors / Garden**
  + 2.5 - 4m around the house (_currently the garden is neglected
    so requires some attention/landscaping_) we are considering the following:
    + Out-door table Tennis (_covered_)
    + Out-door Table Football ("_fuseball_")
    + Hot tub (_we need to gauge demand for it
      and cost it including annual maintenance_)
  + Bird House (_disused_) - the plan is to convert it into something _useful_
  like a sauna/steam room (_which is great for detox/letting off steam..._)
  + Glass Cube for outdoor meditation, reading and isolated creative work.

## 1. Hostel

Our plan is to create a _haven_
for people who are _already_
"Digital Nomads" and/or those who _want_
to _learn_ how to be tech/creative innovators.

Initially the hostel will be "_invite-only_"
(_for reasons we will expand on below_)
but once we are up-and-running
we will have an ***application process*** for people joining.



### What is a "Digital Nomad" ("_DiNo_")?

A "Digital Nomad" (_or_ "_DiNo_" _for short_)
is a person who is "***location-independent***".
A DiNo's does not require visiting a traditional "_office_"
they can ***work from anywhere***
with nothing more than a **Laptop Computer & Internet Connection**.

Much of the "**Knowledge Economy**" work can be done _remotely_.
This lowers the costs to the person doing the work
because they don't have to pay _exorbitant_ "_Metropolis_" rents/prices
(_e.g. London, New York, San Jose, Oslo, Tokyo, etc._)

We @dwyl have _embraced_ remote working from the beginning because we know
that as long as people have a quite place to focus on their work,
it can be done from _anywhere_.

Quite a few of the dwyl team members have worked remotely over the past
couple of years from interesting places such as Bali, Japan, Mexico, Columbia,
Spain, France, Belgium, Scotland, Portugal, USA, Canada, New Zealand etc
(_the list goes on!_).
But until now we haven't been able to _provide_ the destination for people
to go and live & work remotely.
And while "Braga" might not be a "beach in Thailand" it does have
certain _other_ advantages which are detailed below which will
make it attractive to DiNos.


### How Many Beds?

There is space for 48 beds (24 Bunks) in the house if we were to _maximise_ it,
but our purpose is to make it _comfortable_ for everyone
so our plan is to `limit` it to 24 bunk beds (12 bunks); 4 bunks per large room.

### Hostel Requirements and Considerations

+ Firstly we need to _enquire_ about ***licensing/regulations***
to operate a "Bed and Breakfast" or "Youth Hostel"
in the area and specifically that location.
+ **_Secure_ bicycle parking**. (_off street_) - how many spaces?
+ **Solar panels** - what is the pay-back period (_financial_)
and can we _justify_ investing in panels immediately?
(_can we use the bank loan to finance them_?)
+ **Bunk Beds** - are there already _great_ quality beds we can use
or do we need to spec/design and order our own from scratch.

## 2. Workspace

Our plan is to have **24 sit/stand desks**
available to the 24 people staying with us.
The desks will be primarily in the "Main Office" 18 desks.
Each desk will measure 100 x 70cm

We will encourage people to work in the "Main Room"
from 08:00 - 16:00



## 3. Creative Technology Learning Center





The purpose of Braga is not to _live_ in Braga "_for ever_"
in the same way that the purposes of MDC was to live in SE5 for ever.
