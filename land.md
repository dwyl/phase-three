# Land

The decision of where to buy our land 
for "_Phase Three_" requires _careful consideration_.

While _all_ of us would _love_ to live near the **ocean**, 
there is an important consideration 
if we plan to use the land as our "_base_" 
for a decent stretch of time 
e.g. 30+ years.

Sea level rise is no longer a debate:

It's easy to make fun of this issue ...
["_We didn't listen_..."](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=we+didn%27t+listen)
and even _easier_ to feel 
["_powerless_"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness)
and thus _do nothing_ about it.

But I _urge_ you to watch the 
**National Geographic Documentary** 
[***Before the Flood***](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=before+the+flood)

How did you _feel_ after watching the Documentary?

Are you _beginning_ to think that _maybe_ a 
[mountain-top](https://thetrek.co/10-appalachian-trail-photos/)
**_way_ above sea level** is a **_good_ idea**...? ðŸ˜‰

As the global temperature continues to rise,
both the sea levels will rise
and hurricanes will intensify.
Higher ground, sheltered from extreme weather events
and access to abundant fresh drinking water 
will increasingly become _essential_.

We are using issues so that we can _discuss_ our requirements
further and eventually reach a consensus on what our "_perfect_"
land will be! 
please get share your thoughts by commenting on the issues!!
