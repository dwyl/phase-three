# Phase Two

The decision of where to buy our land for "_Phase Two_" requires _careful consideration_.

While I think _all_ of us would _love_ to live near the ocean, there are
a few things to _consider_ if we plan to use the land as our "_base_" for
a decent stretch of time e.g. 20+ years.

I love everything about the Ocean, and as a kid,
I _really_ wanted to live near the beach. <br />

But on returning to a well-known beach in Portugal (_where I swam as a child_)
I realized that the peak/high tide was _visibly_ (_much_) higher (_up the beach_) than it had been 24 years earlier when I swam there as a child ... and it dawned on me that the future does not bode well for beach-front land.

It's easy to make fun of this issue ...
["_We didn't listen_..."](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=we+didn%27t+listen)
and even _easier_ to feel "_powerless_" and thus _do nothing_ about it.

But I _urge_ you to watch the **National Geographic Documentary** "***Before the Flood***":

How did you _feel_ after watching the Documentary? Share your thoughts:

Are you _beginning_ to think that _maybe_ a [mountain-top](https://thetrek.co/10-appalachian-trail-photos/)
_way_ above sea level is a _good_ idea...? ;-)

We are using issues so that we can _discuss_ our requirements
further and eventually reach a consensus on what our "_perfect_"
land will be! please get share your thoughts by commenting on the issues!!
