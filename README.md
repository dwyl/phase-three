# Phase Two

I love everything about the Ocean, and as a kid,
I _really_ wanted to live near the beach. <br />

But on returning to a well-known beach in Portugal (_where I swam as a child_)
I realized that the tide was _much_ higher than it had been 15 years earlier
it dawned on me that the future does not bode well for beach-front land.

It's easy to make fun of this issue ...
["_We didn't listen_..."](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=we+didn%27t+listen)
and even _easier_ to feel "_powerless_" and thus _do nothing_ about it.

But I _urge_ you to watch the **National Geographic Documentary** "***Before the Flood***":

How did you _feel_ after watching the Documentary? Share your thoughts:
