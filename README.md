# Phase Two

If you are the kind of person who likes thinking _long-term_ and _high-impact_
this repo is for you!

**D**o **W**hat **Y**ou **L**ove is _not_ a 3-month stepping-stone project, we're in it for the long-haul.

### Our Goal/Mission

> Help people understand and achieve their potential through technology.

So what does this encompass? Any number of things that will need to be split out into measurable goals:
+ Living a happy life
+ Financial sustainability https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/42
+ Life-long learning
+ Health https://github.com/dwyl/health
+ Sustainable living https://github.com/dwyl/aquaponics
+ Living with purpose and ethics https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/155
+ Understanding how to be deal with today's constant distraction and information overload
+ And many more!

### What is important to us?
Our [manifesto]() does a good job of transmitting our beliefs (although a [tidy-up is needed](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/issues/80)!) so a quick re-iteration of the key points:
+ People- and user-centric
+ Life-long learning community
+ Open source
+ [Hyper-transparency](https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/140), building dwyl 'out in the open'
+ Accessibility (to all of our offerings)
+ Socially impactful
+ Sustainability
+ Data driven & data *privacy* driven
