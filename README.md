# Phase Two

If you are the kind of person who likes thinking _long-term_ and _high-impact_
this repo is for you!

**D**o **W**hat **Y**ou **L**ove is _not_ a stepping-stone project, we're in it for the long-haul. And after a year and a half, we're making sure that the direction we're heading in is clear to everyone who wants to know.

### Our Goal/Mission

> Empower people to sustainably unlock their potential and pursue their passion through technology.

So what does this encompass? Any number of things that will need to be split out into measurable goals:
+ Living a happy life
+ Financial sustainability https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/42
+ Life-long learning
+ Productivity
+ Health https://github.com/dwyl/health
+ Sustainable living https://github.com/dwyl/aquaponics
+ Living with purpose and ethics https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/155
+ Understanding how to be deal with today's constant distraction and information overload
+ And many more!

### Guiding Principles
Our [manifesto]() does a good job of transmitting our beliefs (although a [tidy-up is needed](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/issues/80)!) so a quick re-iteration of the key points:
+ People- and user-centric
+ Life-long learning community
+ Open source
+ [Hyper-transparency](https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/140), building dwyl 'out in the open'
+ Accessibility (to all of our offerings)
+ Socially impactful
+ Sustainability
+ Data driven & data *privacy* driven

### How will we achieve this?
[The Plan](/plan.md) [WiP - read at your own peril :wink:]. For now this
focuses on 'Phase 1.5', what we will need to **get from where we are now to a
place where we can start investing in longer-term sustainable living and wellbeing**.

### Our Vision
Creating sustainable products, services, experiences and environments that enrich lives.
