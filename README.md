# Phase Three

</div>


If you like thinking 
_long-term_ and _high-impact_
this repo is for you!

**D**o **W**hat **Y**ou **L**ove is _not_ a stepping-stone, 
we're in it for the long-haul. <br />
We are making sure that the direction 
we're heading in is clear to everyone who wants to know.

## Our Goal/Mission

> Empower people to 
> sustainably unlock their potential 
> and pursue their life's purpose.

So what does this encompass? 
Any number of things 
that will need to be split out 
into measurable goals:

+ Living a happy and fulfilling life
+ Financial sustainability 
  [**#42**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/42)
+ Life-long learning: 
  [?q=learn](https://github.com/orgs/dwyl/repositories?language=&q=learn&sort=&type=all)
+ Health: [dwyl/health](https://github.com/dwyl/health)
+ Sustainable symbiotic agriculture: 
  [dwyl/learn-**aquaponics**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-aquaponics/issues)
+ Living with purpose and ethics 
  [#155](https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/155)
+ Deal with today's constant distraction and information overload
+ And many more!

## Guiding Principles

Our 
[manifesto](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/master/manifesto.md) 
does a good job of transmitting our beliefs 
so we won't duplicate it here.
A quick re-iteration of the key points:

+ People-centric (UX-focussed)
+ Life-long learning community
+ Open source
  [Hyper-transparency](https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/140), 
  building dwyl 'out in the open'
+ Accessibility (to all of our offerings)
+ Socially impactful
+ Sustainability
+ Data driven & data *privacy* driven

## How will we achieve this?

[The Plan](/plan.md) [Work-in-progress]. 
For now this focuses on 'Phase 1.5', 
what we will need to 
get from where we are **now** 
to a place where we can 
start investing in 
longer-term sustainable living and wellbeing.

## Our Vision

Creating sustainable 
products, services, experiences 
and environments 
that enrich lives.

We _very much_ want to hear your thoughts on this 
so if you have _time_
_please_ read and _comment_ on the 
[issues](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues)


## Name? 

The name "**Phase _Three_**"
refers to the third phase 
of our lives 
that we all hope to reach some day.
[**`#Third_age`**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age#Third_age)

We must all embrace and plan for this phase
by proactively taking steps while we are young.

That is the purpose of this repository.
