# Douro Riverside Family & Friends Food Forest Farmstead<sup>*</sup>

<sup>*</sup> We're going to need a shorter name. 

</div>

After _years_ of searching 
we think we have found an _amazing_ spot.
It ticks _all_ the boxes 
to build our vision. üòç

> Note: Extended discussion of the land is contained in the issue thread:
[#116](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/116) üí¨

This document is meant to serve as a _proposal_ 
and answer as many of our questions as possible.
If you have still have questions after reading it,
please comment on the issue/thread: 
[#116](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/116) üôè 
Or if you think of something new e.g. a "gotcha" or idea,
please open a **`new`** issue to capture it. 

Thanks! 

# Why?

We aren't getting any younger.
We have to proactively think about our own "third age"
and plan for the retirement of our parents.


## _Where_ to Live?

Having recently been blessed with a child 
and with another "on the way",
it's brought the "_where to spend our time?_" question 
into sharp focus.

Living in the city 
is good for all the modern conveniences
like easy access to shops, 
healthcare and government services.
Braga is a fantastic little city 
with _most_ of the things
a young family or older folks can wish for; 
good schools, 
organic food shops
and good activities.
However it's still a city.
There is road noise/pollution, 
limited access to nature
and little space for growing our own food.

# What?

Our idea is to purchase 
a very _specific_ piece of land 
in the Douro Region of northern Portugal.


## _Golden_

The Portuguese word **douro** 
translates to ***golden***:

We think it's a fitting name for the area;
it really is golden. üòç <br />
Gold bullion [coins, bars, etc.]
is widely regarded as a safe store of wealth.
Land similarly has not been know to _devalue_ over time. 
However, unlike **gold** that we cannot _eat_
if we're hungry,
fertile land 
with abundant water
and sunshine
_can_ produce food
we can eat 
for the rest of our lives.
I would argue that the ROI on land 
is _considerably_ better than Gold
as it has an "annual dividend" of fresh produce
while still benefiting from capital appreciation.

## _Access_ to Land `!==` Freedom to Grow Food

While we are lucky enough 
to have _access_ to land through family,
it is not _our_ land 
if we wanted to do _anything_
we have to constantly ask for 
[_permission_](https://github.com/mosteirodelandim/site/issues/4).

What we want is land we own outright
that we can grow _anything_ we want.


## Space to Grow!

As noted in the 
[issues](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues)
we plan to grow a _wide_ variety of fruit trees.
Our [**`list of fruit trees`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/6) 
currently has **`34`** fruits
and we plan to plant **several _varieties_** in each type.
So we won't just have _one_ Apple Tree,
we'll have at **_least_ 10**.

## Food Forrest üå≥

In addition to all the fruit trees we want to plant,
we will follow the 
[permaculture food forest](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/77#issuecomment-1239168081)
method to foster a lush wilderness
with _hundreds_ of edible plant spices.

## Botanical Garden üè°

We plan to create labels/plaques
with botanical name and other relevant info
and a QR Code for all the major species.
These will be laser/CNC-cut so that 
our food forrest will be a 
[Botanical Garden](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/95)

We will allow children/students from the local schools
to visit and learn about the plants and ecosystems.

### Geodesic Greenhouse üå±

In addition to the open-air food forest,
we will have a decent size [tbd]
geodesic greenhouse structure
that will allow us to grow tropical plants
that need specific temperatures to thrive.
This will be an especially great place to be
during the winter months.

## Bees üêù

Sadly, one person in In√™s' family is allergic to bee stings,
so having a bee hive is out-of-the-question on their family-owned land.
It's a total misconception that bees sting people without good reason.
I did a bee-keeping course 
and have been around hives a lot without ever being stung.

We will 100% be installing bee hives on _our_ land 
at the furthest edge from the main house.
There will be prominent warning signs
and we will have a first aid station
with the necessary treatment options.

For maximizing crop yields keeping bees is a no-brainer.
And since most of us also like honey, 
and there will be plenty of wax,
we will have two _useful_ and "free" byproducts.
