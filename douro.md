# Douro Riverside Family & Friends Food Forest Farm Tiny Home Village<sup>*</sup>

<sup>*</sup> _We're going to need a shorter name_ ... **`#HelpWanted`** 💭

</div>

After 
[***years***](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/3) 
of **searching** ... 🔍<br />
we think we have found an **_amazing_ spot**. 😍 <br />
It ticks _all_ the boxes 
to build our vision: 🌱

+ [x] Abundant/Unlimited Water 
  [**`#21`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/21) 🚰
  + [x] Access to a year-round _navegable_ river 
+ [x] Excellent air quality == longevity 
  [**`#103`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/103) 🌬️
+ [x] Unobstructed sunlight for plants  and solar panels 
  [**`#7`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/7) ☀️
+ [x] Superb soil fertility for growing organic food 
  [**`#87`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/87) 🥦
  [**`#90`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/90) 🫐
+ [x] Relative seclusion (low noise) for a more peaceful life. 
+ [x] Existing/established trees (ideally a forest!) 
  [**`#6`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/6) 🌳
+ [x] Ruins to rebuild.  
  Much faster than getting planning permission to build from scratch.
  Still means we get to pick all the fixtures/fittings. 🏡
+ [x]

# Why?

We aren't getting any younger. <br />
We must _proactively_ think about our own "third age" _long_ before we _need_ to <br />
and plan for the imminent retirement of our parents.


# What?

Our idea is to purchase 
a very _specific_ piece of land 
in the Douro Region of northern Portugal.




## _Golden_

The Portuguese word **douro** 
translates to ***golden***:

[translate.google.com/?text=douro](https://translate.google.com/?sl=pt&tl=en&text=douro%0A&op=translate)

<img width="833" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/188555192-1b7cbbf1-c75f-465f-bdfd-fb82d27f6d6c.png">

We think it's a fitting name for the area;
it really is golden. 😍 <br />
Gold bullion [coins, bars, etc.]
is widely regarded as a safe store of wealth.
Land similarly has not been know to _devalue_ over time. 
However, unlike **gold** that we cannot _eat_
if we're hungry,
fertile land 
with abundant water
and sunshine
_can_ produce food
we can eat 
for the rest of our lives.
I would argue that the ROI on land 
is _considerably_ better than Gold
as it has an "annual dividend" of fresh produce
while still benefiting from capital appreciation.

## UNESCO World Heritage Site

The surrounding area where the land [under consideration] 
is a World Heritage Site. 
Read the Wiki page for more info:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douro_DOC

Everywhere you look is a postcard of epic landscapes:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189114089-a5134ef7-7dae-47e2-be85-d37a2d0dcecb.png)


![douro-river-postcard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189154546-4e79f6b1-8f61-4b4c-b9aa-413e23c53676.jpeg)

# Where?

Having recently been blessed with a child 
and with another "on the way",
it's brought the question 
"_**where** to spend our time?_" 
into sharp focus.

Living in the city 
is good for all the modern conveniences
like easy access to shops, 
healthcare and government services.
Braga is a fantastic small city 
with _most_ of the things
a young family 
or older folks 
can wish for; 
good schools, 
organic food shops,
great restaurants,
and good activities.
However it's still a city.
Even though it has comparatively
_good_ air quality,
there is road noise/pollution, 
limited access to nature
and little space for growing our own food.

We need _space_ to grow our own food and imagination!

## Souselo

The land we are considering is based in **`Souselo`**: 
[wikipedia.org/wiki/Souselo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souselo)

[google.com/maps/@41.0600253,-8.2457732](https://www.google.com/maps/@41.0600253,-8.2457732,283a,35y,3.29t/data=!3m1!1e3)

<img width="1633" alt="land-topology-map" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189042105-f433a989-b675-457c-b9a4-1bb411c48b07.png">

### Vila Meã

The nearest village is Vila Meã. 
It's tiny. 
Has only a handful of houses and no shops/services.
Map of the area 
featuring several sightseeing stops 
and existing accommodation: 

<img width="1666" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189066783-82d785bf-c498-4893-8096-fd440864f104.png">




# Who?

The land will be run as a 
Food Forest Farm for "Family & Friends".

The Main House will be renovated and serve as a Family home.
But rather than having a "weekend home" 
that we use a handful of times per year,
it will be listed on booking.com, AirBnb, etc.
Thus families up to 10 peole 
from both PT and abroad
will be able to rent it 
and enjoy the organic permaculture lifestyle.  

One of the smaller cottages will be renovated 
and serve as the "**Caretaker Cottage**" (see below).


## Farm Manager (part-time)

This will be inhabited by [**`@carolrmc`**]
who will take on the part-time role of Farm Manager.
Carol will be responsible 
for managing/tracking the work that needs to be done

## Cleaning Person

The cleaning person will be hired from the local area.
We expect to pay **`€6/h`** and for them to work **`3h/day`**
i.e. 3h x 5days x €6 x 52 weeks = €4,680/year

Task will include:
+ [x] Cleaning the main house & cottages
+ [x] Laundry and linen changes
+ [x] Turning over the Tiny Homes as we build them
+ [x] Food prep e.g. retrieving ingredients from the veg garden or fruit trees
+ [x] General light yard work such as collecting fallen leaves

Once we ramp up the number of Tiny Homes in the Village,
we will move to employing cleaning people full-time year-round.


## Volunteer Visitors

We intend to list the farm on several 
work-for-room+board websites
so that people who want to visit
the farm and do **`4h/day`** of work 
in exchange for room & board.
They will learn Portugese (or English!)
and lots about permaculture and sustainable living.

See [Workaway](#workaway) section below.


# How?

The first step in determining the feasibility
of this project is to look at the finances/projections.

## How _Much_? 💰

The up-front cost of the land is **`€270,000`** 
[**`£234,495`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/116#issuecomment-1240250648).
There will be additional legal fees
and paperwork from the council [tbd].
We estimate that will be another **`€2k`**.
So all-in the cost to purchase will be **`€272k`**.

That is where the costs _start_! 💸

# Why We Need Our _Own_ Land?

As you will see from reading the next section,
to 

## _Access_ to Land `!==` Freedom to Grow Food

While we are lucky enough 
to have _access_ to land through family,
it is not _our_ land 
if we wanted to do _anything_
we have to constantly ask for 
[_permission_](https://github.com/mosteirodelandim/site/issues/4).

What we want is land we own outright
that we can grow _anything_ we want.


## Space to Grow!

As noted in the 
[issues](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues)
we plan to grow a _wide_ variety of fruit trees.
Our [**`list of fruit trees`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/6) 
currently has **`34`** fruits
and we plan to plant **several _varieties_** in each type.
So we won't just have _one_ Apple Tree,
we'll have at **_least_ 10**.

## Food Forrest 🌳

In addition to all the fruit trees we want to plant,
we will follow the 
[permaculture food forest](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/77#issuecomment-1239168081)
method to foster a lush wilderness
with _hundreds_ of edible plant spices.

## Botanical Garden 🏡

We plan to create labels/plaques
with botanical name and other relevant info
and a QR Code for all the major species.
These will be laser/CNC-cut so that 
our food forrest will be a 
[Botanical Garden](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/95)

We will allow children/students from the local schools
to visit and learn about the plants and ecosystems.

### Geodesic Greenhouse 🌱

In addition to the open-air food forest,
we will have a decent size [tbd](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/122)
geodesic dome greenhouse structure
that will allow us to grow tropical plants
that need specific temperatures to thrive.
This will be an especially great place to be
during the winter months.

![geodesic-greenhouse](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/188852607-cfa886a7-6a78-4000-a055-8125be45abad.png)

See: 
[**`#122`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/122)

## Pedagogical Forest Farm _School_

We are _huge_ fans of the idea 
of outdoor learning for our children.
This concept is well-established
in the Nordic countries:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_school_(learning_style)

Children as young as 3 spend _most_ of their day
outdoors learning in nature.
They explore their surroundings,
discover flora, fauna and how to make things.

There are already a couple of forest(ish) schools in Portugal
but none of the come _close_ 
to what is _possible_ with the land we are considering.

### Farm Animals

One of our son's favorite places to visit in Braga
is the **Braga Pedagogical Farm**:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braga_Pedagogical_Farm

<img width="989" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189090045-437279ba-75ed-4ffb-a57c-5fc93b2c1557.png">

They have several farm animals 
kept in relatively small enclosures.
The visitors are not allowed to feed or touch the animals
(_for obvious reasons, 
most children would hit the lamb 
if it tried to nibble their hand while feeding ..._).

We will allow our kids (under supervision)
to _interact_ with the animals.

We think that having contact with animals
will help our children (and farm friends)
better understand the animals
and think harder about _eating_ them. 💭

### Ducks

Being water-front property,
it's _ideal_ for keeping ducks.
We've done a decent amount of research into this:



### Bees 🐝 

Sadly, one person in Inês' family is allergic to bee stings,
so having a bee hive is out-of-the-question on their family-owned land.
It's a total misconception that bees sting people without good reason.
I did a bee-keeping course 
and have been around hives a lot without ever being stung.

We will 100% be installing
[**_transparent_ bee hives**](https://youtu.be/9ItlOFLTUAs) 
on _our_ land 
at the furthest edge from the main house.
There will be prominent warning signs
and we will have a first aid station
with the necessary treatment options.

#### Organic Honey 🍯 and Wax 🕯️

For maximizing crop yields keeping bees is a no-brainer.
And since most of us also like honey, 
and there will be plenty of wax,
we will have two _useful_ and "free" byproducts.

There are _many_ applications for both honey and wax
that aren't consuming it in tea or making candles.
See: 
[**`#89`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/89#issuecomment-1239227456)

### Aquaponics 🐟 + 🌱

We plan to build our own water tanks at the highest point 
on the land to store water for gravity-fed irrigation. 
In those tanks we will place several species of fish.
The fish will eat 

## Energy / Power



### Solar Panels

### Pumped-storage Hydroelectricity

# Relevant Reading + Research 🔍




One of the obvious considerations/concerns 

## Hospital 🏥

The nearest hospital with full-service 
(Radiology, Operating Theatre, etc.)
is **`23km`** away. 
The estimated journey time is **`28 minutes`**:

<img width="417" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/188856534-7aa455e7-0c95-4977-b136-62b8928e21d7.png">

In an emergency we would drive our [TimeMachine]() 
and cut this journey time down baring safety in-mind.

### On-site First Aid Center ⚕️

We will do everything we can to minimize risk to health & safety,
by having well-defined systems,
but we know accidents happen 
and they need to be addressed swiftly.
Having a dedicated first aid center (adjoining the reception)
at the entrance/exit of the property will be a high priority.



## Douro Cruises

There is _thriving_ river cruise, vinyard tour and culinary experience tourism industry in the Douro area:

## _Existing_ Local Guest Houses

There are already 15 guest houses 
in the local area within a 1 km radius
listed on Booking.com:
[https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1FCAsouwFCHWNhc2EtZGEtaWxoYS1jYXN0ZWxvLWRlLXBhaXZhSDNYBGi7AYgBAZgBCbgBB8gBDNgBAegBAfgBC4gCAagCA7gCgsPmmAbAAgHSAiQ1YjVhZmNkMi0wNjlhLTQ1NTEtYjg3NS1mODkwNzZmZDI1MDHYAgbgAgE&sid=7b47415b9fa49b9dbd60ee24312ebc86&aid=304142&sb=1&src_elem=sb&error_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fpt%2Fcasa-da-ilha-castelo-de-paiva.en-gb.html%3Flabel%3Dgen173nr-1FCAsouwFCHWNhc2EtZGEtaWxoYS1jYXN0ZWxvLWRlLXBhaXZhSDNYBGi7AYgBAZgBCbgBB8gBDNgBAegBAfgBC4gCAagCA7gCgsPmmAbAAgHSAiQ1YjVhZmNkMi0wNjlhLTQ1NTEtYjg3NS1mODkwNzZmZDI1MDHYAgbgAgE%26sid%3D7b47415b9fa49b9dbd60ee24312ebc86%26room1%3DA%252CA%3Bsb_price_type%3Dtotal%3Btype%3Dtotal%26%26&highlighted_hotels=5014883&hp_sbox=1&dest_id=900050875&dest_type=city&origin=hp&hp_avform=1&do_availability_check=on&no_redirect_check=1&checkin_year=2022&checkin_month=9&checkin_monthday=30&checkout_year=2022&checkout_month=10&checkout_monthday=2&group_adults=2&group_children=1&no_rooms=1&age=1&b_h4u_keep_filters=&from_sf=1&order=review_score_and_price)

We've gone through each one 
and taken screenshots [`#116`](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/116#issuecomment-1240391427)

The _cheapest_ option in the area
is **`€120/night`** for 2 adults and 1 child:
**Solar Guesthouse Olival da Vinha**: https://www.booking.com/hotel/pt/solar-guest-house-olival-da-vinha.en-gb.html

<img width="1270" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189115923-647ce3fe-fb4c-499a-a24a-ff26dc86366e.png">

It has nice decor and a good location 
**`400m`** from the centre of Castelo de Paiva.
But it's quite far from the river (no access), 
doesn't have a pool or other amenities.

This is the view from the guest house:

<img width="1252" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189116647-5d707ba7-101b-491f-b21e-fb4a07b6c59e.png">

A bit "meh" IMO ...

Then they have a bunch of pictures of the surrounding area:

<img width="1252" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189116582-c7537416-8a2e-4f4f-a86e-2d6c7682a1c1.png">

Again, we think this is a _really_ good sign.
It shows that there is demand at the higher price point.
More on this later.
