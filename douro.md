we think we have found an **_amazing_ spot**. 😍 <br />
It ticks _all_ the boxes 
to build our vision: 🌱

+ [x] **Abundant/Unlimited Water**
  [**`#21`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/21) 🚰
  + [x] **Bonus**: access to a year-round **pristine _navegable_ river** ⛵

# Why?

Top 5 Reasons:

## 1. Planning for Older Age / Retirement 🌳

We aren't getting any younger. <br />
We must _proactively_ think 
about our own "third age" 
_long_ before we _need_ to <br />
and plan for the imminent retirement of our parents.

## 2. An _Awesome_ Place for Our Children to Thrive! 😍

Having grown up in major cities
but with friends who lived on farms in the countryside,
I know which I would have preferred for myself;
**unquestionably _nature_**! 

> **Note**: We aren't "_sacrificing_" living in the city.
As outlined below I'm proposing a "hybrid lifestyle".
We would still spend enough time in the city.
And the land is 10 mins from a town 
with all the major supermarkets and amenities.


## 3. A Great Way to Live Sustainably ♻️

With space to grow **80%+** of our own food organically,
our own on-site composting and mini-recycling
we can live a zero-waste lifestyle.


## 4. Access to Water Sports! ⛵ 🛶 🏄‍♀️

With 300m 



## 5. Meet Like-minded People 👩‍🌾 

Having a place that _curious_ people
can _apply_ to visit and stay at,
means we will _attract_ interesting 
people we can _learn_ with/from.



### Fresh Air 💨

It's widely known that 
vehicle pollution 
shortens lifespan,
[decreases intelligence](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/27/air-pollution-causes-huge-reduction-in-intelligence-study-reveals)
and reduces quality of life.



### Stars! ⭐

Living in the city with 
[light pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution)
you barely see the moon never mind the stars!
Out in the countryside 
far enough from the nearest low-density town
on a clear night, 

![star-night-milky-way](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/218063972-ee1194c7-2e38-44f3-8efb-3fdbb39d16cb.png)

See:
https://www.space.com/dark-sky-schist-villages-starlight-tourist-destination.html

### Wild Life 🦉

Living in a city, 
when was the last time you saw a bird of prey
other than in a zoo or sanctuary?

The land we are considering has owls in the forest!
And given that the pristine river bordering the land
is _teaming_ with fish,
there are also kingfishers, 
eagles and hawks!

See: 
[wikipedia.org/wiki/**List**_of_**birds**_of_**Portugal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_birds_of_Portugal)



### Abundant Water 🚰


## 3. Short-term Mental & Physical Health

[Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau)
had 
[Walden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden),
[Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) 
had
[Bollingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollingen_Tower)
[Monet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet)
spent 46 years painting in his garden and surrounding 
area of
[Giverney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giverny).

As a teenager,
I had the privilege of visiting Monet's gardens
and the memory persists today;
it's ***epic***! 

If we are able to purchase the land, 
we will make the entrance and top terrace
(where the houses will be)
an _epic_ garden with Koi ponds,
integrated trees,
wheelchair accessible path / walkway
perfect for people of all ages and mobility to enjoy. 



## 4. Long-term Water, Food and Energy Security 





## Why _Now_?

Having recently been blessed with a **child** 👶
and expecting another soon,
we are acutely aware of our time pressures.

Living in the 
[**city**](https://www.idealista.pt/en/news/lifestyle-in-portugal/2020/11/05/782-braga-portugals-happiest-city-and-one-of-the-best-cities-in-europe-to-live-in)
is convenient for shops,
healthcare,
"safe" parks 
and all amenities.
However the road noise, 
pollution, 
litter _everywhere_
limited access to [real] nature
and near-zero food growing space
has us re-considering our options. 💭

There will _never_ be a "good time"
to buy a farm or small piece of land
to plant trees, grow our own food
and build a "country" lifestyle.

If we keep putting it off
until the "**_right_ time**",
we will all be too old 
to do the work
or worse 
**_too old_ to _enjoy_ it**!  

### Trees Take Time

Trees take 10+ years to mature and bare fruit.
If we want the abundant fruits in our **50's`**,
we need to plant them _now_!


## Why _Not_?

For me, the _only_ reason _not_ to do this _now_
is the _huge_ sums of **cash** required
and the investment of **time**
when we have so many other things to do ...

Thankfully, 
having worked for a few years consulting 
for a couple of well-funded FinTech Startups,
saving/investing diligently
and living frugally,
we have accumulated enough savings
to _consider_ this project.

![late-rabbit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/194275223-0ad767e5-a13f-4e4e-a245-7241e09a2ef9.png)

As for the **time**, 
again, we all need to come to terms 
with the fact that there will _never_ be a
time in our lives where we have "spare" time.
We're _always_ going to be 
[time-poor](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220201-the-time-poverty-that-robs-parents-of-success).
That's why we are building an 
[**`App`**](https://github.com/dwyl/app)
that helps us **_maximize_** our **available time**
and not squander any of it.


## Regrets?

By _far_ my biggest regret in life 
is not being born into a wealthy family
with _inherited_ land. 🙄

Why couldn't I just be _born_ into the 
[**1%**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth#Wealth_inequality)
instead of having to work **20 years** to get there? 🤷‍♂️

I intend to _fix_ that for my children
by buying them a farm they can grow up on. 🧑‍🌾

All joking aside,
having river (or beach) access
land is what I always dreamed of as a child. 💭
$$
The STEM, creativity 
and _life_ skills learning opportunities
of living on land are _significantly_
greater than living in a city. 🧑‍🔬

What better way 
to learn about ecosystems
than _living_ in one?

In 20 years time I want to look back on 
today and thank myself 
for investing this effort. ⏳

i.e. _not_ have regrets! 

# What?

The idea is to purchase 
a very _specific_ piece of land 
in the Douro Region of northern Portugal
and transform it into something _magical_!

## Listing

Details of the listing are captured in the issue:
[**`#116`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/116)

But these are the highlights:

1. **2.3 Hectares** of fertile terraced land in the Douro region of Portugal; 🌳 <br />
   a UNESCO World Heritage site of "outstanding beauty". 😍
2. **150 metres** of [navegable] river frontage teaming with fish 🎣<br />
   The property has two accesses to the river one ramp one stairs. 2️⃣ <br />
   The **Paiva** river feeds into the **Douro** **`800m`** downstream;
   We could _easily_ have kayaks, paddle boards and eventually our own 
   [boat](https://github.com/dwyl/tiny-house/issues/34)! ⛵ <br />
   There is _already_ a **mini `private` beach**; 
   we could make an _epic_ one! 🏖️
3. **4 Ruins** to rebuild. 
   These could be: 
   a "main house", 
   a "caretaker flat" 
   and **2 guest cottages**. 🏡 `#SustainableRevenue`
4. **50 minute** drive from 
   [**`OPO`** Porto International Airport](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/116#issuecomment-1261513053) 🛩️ 
5. **`€270k`** asking price. 💰


### Fully Fenced

This is the view of the land from the main road:

<img width="1435" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189234785-d0b321b6-63fe-4fee-94de-64ba3cc14abc.png">

The land is fully fenced but the fence is only shoulder-height.
This is more of an animal barrier than a human security fence.
But it's a good starting point.

#### Berry Hedge 🫐

If we are able to buy the land,
we will plant a barrier hedge
that will serve as both privacy
and fruit e.g: Blackberries, Elderberries, Juneberry or Hazelnut!
See:
[**`#20`**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-permaculture/issues/20)

![blackberry-hedge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/219856094-b9d41249-f027-4bdd-87d8-fc52b4e8dcab.png)


The land already has more Blackberries than we could ever hope to eat:
[**116**#issuecomment-1233583894](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/116#issuecomment-1233583894)

![blackberries](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/187805082-0285adaf-0122-437e-b465-8bcad14493aa.png)

The idea of planting them as a hedge along the road 
is that we **_share_ the abundance** with passers-by.

![berry-hedge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/219856152-df4ade95-b429-458d-a04d-66d3a7b6f6bb.png)


We would prep the land (including irrigation system) 
and plant these _immediately_ 
so that they have plenty of time to grow
in the next few years.




<!--
The current owners of the land appear to have a Land Rover Freelander v1:
<img width="1435" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189235364-8a085106-6542-46d6-9f50-e2b025ec64a0.png">
-->


## _Golden_

The Portuguese word **douro** 
translates to ***golden***:

[translate.google.com/?text=douro](https://translate.google.com/?sl=pt&tl=en&text=douro%0A&op=translate)

<img width="833" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/188555192-1b7cbbf1-c75f-465f-bdfd-fb82d27f6d6c.png">

We think it's a fitting name for the area;
it really is golden. 😍 <br />
Gold bullion [coins, bars, etc.]
is widely regarded as a safe store of wealth.
Land similarly has not been know to _devalue_ over time. 
However, unlike **gold** that we cannot _eat_
if we're hungry,
fertile land 
with abundant water
and sunshine
_can_ produce food
we can eat 
for the rest of our lives.
I would argue that the ROI on land 
is _considerably_ better than Gold
as it has an "**annual dividend**" of **fresh produce**
while still benefiting from capital appreciation.




## UNESCO World Heritage Site 😍

The surrounding area where the land 
is a World Heritage Site; 
a "cultural landscape of outstanding beauty".
https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1046/

Read the Wiki page for more info:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douro_DOC

Everywhere you look is a postcard of epic landscapes:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189114089-a5134ef7-7dae-47e2-be85-d37a2d0dcecb.png)


![douro-river-postcard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189154546-4e79f6b1-8f61-4b4c-b9aa-413e23c53676.jpeg)

# Where?

Having recently been blessed with **_two_ children**,
it's brought the question 
"_**where** to spend our time?_" 
into sharp focus. 

Living in the city 
is _good_ for all the modern conveniences
like easy access to shops, 
healthcare, government services
and (city) leisure activities
like parks, swimming pools & tennis courts. 
Braga is a fantastic small city 
with _most_ of the things
a young family 
or older folks 
can wish for; 
good schools, 
organic food shops,
great restaurants,
and leisure activities.
However it's still a city.
Even though it has comparatively
_good_ air quality,
there is road noise/pollution, 
limited access to nature
and little space for growing our own organic food.

We need _space_ to grow our own food and imaginations! 💭


## Souselo 📍

The land we are considering is based in **`Souselo`**: 
[wikipedia.org/wiki/Souselo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souselo)

[google.com/maps/@41.0600253,-8.2457732](https://www.google.com/maps/@41.0600253,-8.2457732,283a,35y,3.29t/data=!3m1!1e3)

<img width="1633" alt="land-topology-map" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189042105-f433a989-b675-457c-b9a4-1bb411c48b07.png">


We had never _heard_ of Souselo 
before we started researching it.
So don't feel bad 
if it's not familiar to you either.
It's a **_tiny_ village** in northern Portugal 
that borders the Douro and Paiva rivers
and has _fewer_ than **200 registered inhabitants**;
corresponding to a density of 349,2 hab/km².
By comparison, our neighborhood in Braga 
has 32,876 inhabitants;
8 057,8 hab./km²!
Yes, that's not a typo.
_8 thousand_ people per square kilometer
in our neighborhood in Braga.
https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Victor_(Braga)
For reference, the average population density
in 
[London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London) 
is 5,598/km2
and 
[New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)
is
11,313.81/km2.

### Population Density Side-note 😮

Just for fun, here are the mega-cities 
with the highest population density
in the world:
https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237290/cities-highest-population-density/
![high-population-density-cities](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/219906245-e26db8ef-7c9e-474a-88a5-c3d9a1934008.png)

Not many of these are on my "must see" list
much less "must live there" list. 😜
No offense intended to anyone that lives 
in any of these places. 
I just (_strongly_) prefer the country-side
to _any_ urban area. 


### Castelo de Paiva 🏰

The nearest town is is Castelo de Paiva:
[wikipedia.org/Castelo_de_Paiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castelo_de_Paiva)

![castelodepaiva-center](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/219906746-3d5a93df-e160-45e0-af6d-5b56b0d1c4bd.jpg)

It's tiny but has  <br />
A map of the area 
featuring several sightseeing stops 
and existing accommodation: 

<img width="1666" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189066783-82d785bf-c498-4893-8096-fd440864f104.png">

### River Frontage 🏖️

This rotated view allows you to see how wide the river is:

<img width="1435" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189235651-b5376bd7-432a-4cf5-97b7-dc2a1951f746.png">

The _width_ of the river is roughly **`~20m`** 
at the point on the edge of the property 
where there is a ramp down to the water.

![river-frontage-with-ines](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/219908745-45843ea8-b7a6-45f4-ba34-c1e653aa7021.png)

The _depth_ is **`~5m`** directly in front of the land.
While we were viewing the land,
a pleasure tour boat 
from the local **5 Star hotel**
passed by:

![boat-directly-in-front-of-land](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/219909098-0bb9220d-3c27-4da4-8aea-96cbfc258a00.png)

Useful for visualizing the relative width of the river
and a reminder that people _want_ to visit this area.

It's difficult to see in the photos above, 
because the water is quite deep,
but the water is crystal clear in the shallows: 

![crystal-clear-water](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/219908807-f59cc4ba-22d2-44da-a183-2787eacb95c9.png)

The `Paiva` river is considered
one of the cleanest/purest in Europe.

### Crestuma–Lever Dam 🛥️

The river **`Paiva`** flows into the **`Douro`**
a few hundred metres downstream. 
The `Douro` is dammed down-stream by the Crestuma–Lever Dam,
which creates a **strategic water reservoir** 
for the region:
[wikipedia.org/wiki/Crestuma-Lever_Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crestuma%E2%80%93Lever_Dam)


![Barragem-de-Crestuma](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/195951078-b9d7a837-4f48-4f5f-8b66-de455aa74b94.jpg)

There is a hydroelectric power plant that **generates energy**
for the **Porto district** 
and therefore having the water level 
reasonably constant is required.

There are many river cruise boats on this area
so it is _highly_ unlikely that navigability will be lost
any time soon; 
that would _significantly_ impact local tourism/jobs!

### Atlantic Ocean _Access_ 🌍 

The dam has a lock system 
that allows boats (up to `83m` length!)

![BarragemCrestumaLever-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/195786179-01408d1b-8ca6-4664-a035-c13b5f5c80f4.jpg)

to descend from the reservoir to Douro River estuary
and then on to the Atlantic Ocean. ⛵

Passage through the lock must be booked the day before
and costs **`€30`**. <br />
This is the final dam/lock before
reaching the Atlantic so pretty straightforward.

One of the biggest issues with owning a sail boat 
are the year-round docking/marina fees 
(e.g. €500/month! )

Given the (minimum) **5 meter** water depth directly in front of the land,
we could build a simple dock for a 
[sail boat]((https://github.com/dwyl/tiny-house/issues/34))
and use it as the base for Atlantic - and eventually round-the-world - sailing! 💭




# Who? 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

The land will be run as a 
Food Forest Farm for "Family & Friends".

Both our direct family and our **`@dwyl`** "family".
That is anyone who _currently_ (_or previously_)
worked for **`@dwyl`** 
and _future_ members of the community. 

The Main House will be renovated 
and serve as a Family home.
But rather than having a _personal_ "weekend home" 
that we use a handful of times per year,
it will be listed on booking.com, AirBnb, etc.
Thus families up to 10 people 
from both PT and abroad
will be able to rent it 
and enjoy the organic permaculture lifestyle.  

One of the smaller cottages will be renovated 
and serve as the "**Caretaker Cottage**" (see below)
so the person who manages the farm/business 
has a 2-bed residence as part of their "deal".

## Farm Manager (part-time)

[**`@carolrmc`**](https://github.com/carolrmc)
will take on the part-time role (**`2 hours / day`**) 
of Farm Manager.
Carol will be responsible 
for managing/tracking the work that needs to be done
according to our **`Plan`**. 

Luckily, Carol grew up on a farm (of similar size)
and has performed all the jobs that need to be done.
This is the **_perfect_ retirement activity** for her
as their is a _lot_ to be explored! 

> **Note**: Full list of manager tasks TBD.
> There will be good digital systems 
> to help keep track of everything.


## Volunteer Visitors ✋

We intend to list the farm on several 
work-for-room+board websites
so that people who want to visit
the farm and do **`4h/day`** of work 
in exchange for room & board.
They will learn Portugese (or English!)
and lots about permaculture and sustainable living.

See [Workaway](#workaway) section below. 🔗


# How? 🚧

The first step in determining the feasibility
of this project is to look at the finances/projections.

## How _Much_? 💰

The up-front cost of the land is **`€270,000`** 
[**`£234,495`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/116#issuecomment-1240250648).
There will be additional legal fees
and paperwork from the council [tbd].
We estimate that will be another **`€2k`**.
So all-in the cost to purchase will be **`€272k`**.

That is where the costs _start_! 💸

Even though we are well aware of the fact 
that this project is going to require 
_large_ sums of cash,
we also know that we don't need it all _up-front_.
We only need enough to get _started_.


# Revenue 💵

There are **_multiple_ streams** of **revenue** 
for a small holding farm.
The most effective/lucrative one 
is _temporary_ guest accommodation.


## Guest Cottage(s) 🏡

Our research suggests 
a guest cottage in the Douro Region 
rents for a _minimum_ of **`€120/night`**.
We will charge a "***market-clearing***" lower price of **`€80/night`**
while we are establishing the rest of the business. 

These are our _draft_ calculations:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ma5LOmK_vrSrYULjT0_WIHblgy6OU1VThYixeTUivCc

<img width="1080" alt="cost revenue breakdown" 
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/219908377-ee21c04e-025d-4ee5-8040-4ad8bc7f8d50.png">

> **Note**: very happy to discuss/break-down in more detail.
**Please _ask_ any questions** you have. 

Attempted to round-up all the costs
and conservative on the occupancy of the cottages.
Honestly think that in the "peak" months (May - September)
we can get **_full_ occupancy** 
and **_waiting_ list**
with a good **marketing plan**. 



### Renovations? 🏗️

The land has 4 "urban" buildings 
that can be renovated (or re-built).

#### Newest Building 🆕

The newest building as it currently stands is a granite walled shell 
with a concrete slab poured on top:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/194820733-63fe8aa5-511d-493a-b09f-295097ea12fe.png)

The internal dimensions are decent:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/194281055-918656e8-6795-44dd-8972-f5d05e99dee1.png)

I don't think we would "finish" this building 
as the windows are all weird; 
the "face" of the front of the house is this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/194821617-c251c5ae-a04f-4178-88a6-d80f6927ce88.png)


and the basement, currently occupied by chickens:

![low-basement](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/194821214-88127ed1-c4d9-48e4-acf0-1045b71ffcfb.png)
![chickens](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/194821277-5d495f2d-3a88-4869-abbf-4f5b203e2d23.png 
  "chickens in basement")

It's a no-go for me.
I would keep it as a support building 
for storing supplies during our _actual_ build
and then dismantle it and re-use the stones
for something better. 

The dimensions are good and currently stores all their agricultural machines:

![agricultural-machines-inside-building](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/219909400-5ad6cb53-bbbc-4dde-8381-35776b549221.png 
 "agricultural machines inside building")


Yes, it's a "shame" to waste the effort/money someone has put into building it,
but there's no point being "suck" with someone else's poor design choices.
It will cost us €3k to "un-do" this structure.
We will put off the work (and expense!) until all other buildings are _finished_.



## Renovating the 2 Smaller "Cottages" ✌️

The two smaller dwellings on the first terrace
appear to be agricultural buildings:

![agricultural-buildings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/219909475-97190d80-137a-4810-bce7-9f55c343ee26.png
 "agricultural buildings")


Instead of attempting to refurbish these structures
we would contract a local architect/firm
to draw up plans to expand each one by (up to) 30% (that's the law).
We would build 2 compact cottages 
that would sleep up to **6 people**.
We would get full planning permission
for the cottages.

The _internal_ space of the cottages
will be _maximized_ by
having _extra_-tall ceilings
and then "loft" style furniture.

Here's an example for inspiration, care of Zoku hotel, Amsterdam:
[livezoku.com](https://livezoku.com/)

![zoku-hotel-amsterdam](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/219910375-dd44aea2-964a-403c-b2fd-f94aab1b7cc4.png)

See: 
https://www.designindaba.com/articles/creative-work/end-hotel-room-we-know-it

We can do _much, much better_. 


### Caretaker Cottage 

The caretaker cottage will be 
one of the permanent "urban" structures.
The configuration will be:
+ Ground Floor: reduced mobility studio flat with 
  + Discrete fold-away ("murphy") bed
  + Small kitchenette with
    + Sink
    + Kettle
    + Nespresso machine
    + Compact dishwasher
    + Compact 2-zone induction hob
    + Mini-fridge - just for essentials
  + Compact but accessible toilet and walk-in shower.
+ Second Floor: spacious bedroom with: 
  + Large windows that maximize natural light
  + Double Bed 
  + Built-in wardrobe
  + Comfortable chair & desk

The design of the caretaker cottage 
will integrate into the landscaping
such that the second floor will be wheelchair accessible 
via the "upper walkway". 
Therefore the cottage will have **_two_ external doors**
and be prepared for _comprehensive_ access.




## Help Wanted! 🔰

### Part-time Paid Cleaning Person 🧹

The cleaning person will be hired 
from the local area; **`#JobCreation`** <br />
We expect to pay **`€7/h`** 
and for them to work **`3h/day`** <br />
i.e. 3h x 5 days x €7 x 52 weeks = **`€5,460/year`**

Task will include:
+ [x] Cleaning the main house & cottages
+ [x] Laundry and linen changes
+ [x] Turning over the Tiny Homes as we build them
+ [x] Food prep e.g. retrieving ingredients from the veg garden or fruit trees
+ [x] General light yard work such as collecting fallen leaves

Once we ramp up the number of Tiny Homes in the Village,
we will employ cleaning people **_full_-time year-round**.



### `Workaway` 👩‍🌾

`Workaway` is a community + website
that allows "hosts" to list their 
place to stay.
Hosts describe the expected work to be done
in exchange for room and board.

Guests or "workawayers"
are people that want to travel, explore and learn
on a limited budget.
Workawayers typically do **`25 hours`** 
of light work per week 
in exchange for a bed and meals.

See: 
[**`#119`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/119)

We will list our project on `Workaway` 
[and other relevant/similar sites]
as soon as we have our plan clearly layed out
and somewhere for the people to stay.

We feel this will be an _exceptionally_ 
mutually-beneficial arrangement.
People that want to 
(a) visit Portugal,
(b) experience permaculture with awesome leisure activities and 
(c) eliminate their living costs
will _jump_ at this opportunity!


## Main House 🏡

The main house will be built 
on the site of the current half-finished building.

Similar to the cottages,
it will have high ceilings
and "loft" style beds and furniture.

_Initially_ we will rent out the "main house" 
whenever we are not there
to bring as much startup revenue as possible
and start to prove the concept.

Once we have established the rest of the plan,
and can _afford_ to not rent the main house
we will keep it just for "Friends & Family" guests.
i.e. not listed _publicly_ on the website 
(or 3<sup>rd</sup> party booking sites).


## `YouTube` Channel

We need to create/publish _regular_ videos.
These will serve both as educational videos for _ourselves_,
our guests and the wider community.

### Sample topics:

+ **Permaculture**: from seed to producing plant/tree. 
  There are at least **500 videos** just here! (1 per week for 10 years)
  + Seed -> Tree -> Pruning -> Pests -> Fruit for each variety of 
  [tree](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/6) we have planned. 
  This is "evergreen" content that, 
  if we have good production quality, 
  will last for ever!
+ **_Healthy_ Food**: Cooking with the ingredients we grow.
+ **Off-grid STEM**: Solar/Hydro Power, irrigation systems, outdoor cooking.
+ **Tiny Homes**: research, planning, construction, pricing, maintenance, integrating guest feedback.
+ **Local tours**: tours of the surrounding area; if we go somewhere, capture it!
+ **Mental Health**: ASMR "day in the life" videos e.g: 
  + walks through the food forest in the various seasons; just the sound of nature.
    captions/subtitles for detail where required.
+ **Making Stuff**: making useful things using materials from the land e.g. wood, bamboo, grasses, stone, etc.
+ **Arts & Crafts**: more traditional arts & crafts such as painting, tapestry.

This list is by no means exhaustive.
Feel free to add to it.
Point is: there are **_many_ topics** we can cover.
There is easily enough for **_daily_ update videos**!
But we will start with just "regular updates" (e.g. monthly)
to not overwhelm ourselves and set unrealistic expectations.
Video will be our single best form of "marketing"
and will be the source of people for our _next_ stream of revenue.

## Tiny House(s) 🏠

The (_hopefully_) main source of _non-virtual_ revenue
will be hiring Tiny Houses to families
and couples 
who want a _taste_ of "**The Good Life™**".
People who love the _idea_ of
self-sufficiency living off the land,
but either don't have the resources or _time_
to build something themselves.

We have done _considerable_
research into Tiny Houses over the years.

There is _ample_ space on the land
for 20+ tiny houses
with plenty of privacy around each one.

![tiny-house-terrace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/219919964-29c0c56d-a4ec-41aa-85a4-506379adc743.png)

We will start out with 1 tiny house
and build up to 6 on the terrace.



### Specification 📝

Our Tiny Houses will have a standard spec
which will make them easy to clean/maintain 
and very re-sellable if we need to unlock funds.

See: 
[dwyl/**tiny-house**](https://github.com/dwyl/tiny-house/)


#### Beds 🛏️

Each Tiny House will be purpose-built to accommodate
**`2 adults`** and up to **4 children**.
We know that the _average_ number 
of children per family in Europe 
is 
[**`1.6`**](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Fertility_statistics)
but we are working with the edge-case.
And will _encourage_ families 
to bring their child's  friend(s) 
for the week/weekend.

+ [x] 1 Double bed (loft)
+ [x] 2 fold-down beds
+ [x] 1 _comfortable_ sofa bed (sleeps 2)

Both the sofa bed and fold-down beds 
will be **`80cm`** wide and **`190cm`** long;
so perfectly big enough for 98% of adults.
So if a group of adult friends 
wanted to rent the cabin for a week/weekend
they could squeeze in.

#### Bathroom

The bathroom will be deliberately "basic"
but fully functional with a _flushing_ toilet and shower
with grey water capture.

> **Note**: each parking spot on the land will have 
> a mini water storage and treatment plant. 
> This will add ~ €500 to the setup cost but will
> allow for "modern luxury" [flushing] 
> instead of composting toilets.


#### Kitchen

Rather than having a "_full_" kitchen 
each Tiny House will have a "mini" kitchen 
with basic amenities:

+ Kettle
+ Nespresso machine
+ Mini-fridge
+ IKEA 1-zone Induction Hob 
+ Sink for _manual_ dish-washing 
  (unless we can find a reasonably priced 
    [mini dishwasher](https://github.com/dwyl/tiny-house/issues/35) ...)


#### Water

The Tiny House will have a _removable_
**`200 litre`** tank for drinking water.

A grey water [Kitchen Sink, Dishwasher & Shower]
tank will collect all re-useable water.

#### Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC)

Each tiny home will have heat pump AirCon system
with a mini-split for ultimate comfort in all weather conditions.


To comply with weight restrictions for road legality,
the AirCon unit will be removable.


#### Electricity, Batteries and Grid Connection

Each tiny house will have a 
[battery bank]()
which will kick in at night 
when solar is unavailable.

But will also be connected to the "mains"
electricity [generated by the nearby Hydro dam]
for when the sun isn't shining.

# Why We Need Our _Own_ Land?

As you will see from reading the next section,
we want to plant _many_ varieties 
of trees, annual and perennial plants
so we need a decent amount of space. 


## _Access_ to Land `!==` Freedom to Grow Food

While we are lucky enough 
to have _access_ to land through family,
it is not _our_ land 
if we wanted to do _anything_
we have to constantly ask for 
[_permission_](https://github.com/mosteirodelandim/site/issues/4).

What we want is land we own outright
that we can grow _anything_ we want.
-->

## Space to Grow!

As noted in the 
[issues](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues)
we plan to grow a _wide_ variety of fruit trees.
Our [**`list of fruit trees`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/6) 
currently has **`37`** fruits
and we plan to plant **several _varieties_** in each type.
So we won't just have _one_ Apple Tree,
we'll have at **_least_ 10**.

We plan to grow a wide variety of annual edible plants;
fruits, vegetables, flowers and other ground cover.
see: 
[**`#87`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/87)
(please add to the list!)

The **`2.3ha`** of land 
is _more_ than enough space
to plant 500+ fruiting trees 
around the periphery
and then grow ample annual crops. 

## Permaculture Food Forest 🌳

We will follow the 
[permaculture food forest](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/77#issuecomment-1239168081)
method to foster a lush wilderness
with _hundreds_ of edible plant spices
water capture/storage, 
and biodiversity (friendly insects).

> **Note**: the reason we will focus on _edible_ plants
> is that we want the garden/forest to be friendly 
> to children who are just starting to walk
> and still exploring by putting _everything_ in their mouthes.

## Botanical Garden 🏡

We plan to create labels/plaques
with botanical name and other relevant info
and a QR Code for all the major species.
These will be laser/CNC-cut so that 
our food forrest will be a 
[Botanical Garden](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/95)

We will welcome children/students from the local schools
to visit and learn about the plants and ecosystems.

### Geodesic Greenhouse 🌱

In addition to the open-air food forest,
we will have a decent size 
[tbd](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/122)
geodesic dome greenhouse structure
that will allow us to grow tropical plants
that need specific temperatures to thrive.
This will be an especially great place to be
during the winter months.

![geodesic-greenhouse](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/188852607-cfa886a7-6a78-4000-a055-8125be45abad.png)

See: 
[**`#122`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/122)

## Pedagogical Forest Farm _School_

We are _huge_ fans of the idea 
of outdoor learning for our children.
This concept is well-established
in the Nordic countries:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_school_(learning_style)

Children as young as 3 spend _most_ of their day
outdoors learning in nature.
They explore their surroundings,
discover flora, fauna and how to make things.

There are already a couple of forest(ish) schools in Portugal
but none of the come _close_ 
to what is _possible_ with the land we are considering.

### Farm Animals

One of our son's favorite places to visit in Braga
is the **Braga Pedagogical Farm**:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braga_Pedagogical_Farm

<img width="989" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/189090045-437279ba-75ed-4ffb-a57c-5fc93b2c1557.png">

They have several farm animals 
kept in relatively small enclosures.
The visitors are not allowed to feed or touch the animals
(_for obvious reasons, 
most children would hit the lamb 
if it tried to nibble their hand while feeding ..._).

We will allow our kids (under supervision)
to _interact_ with the animals.

We think that having contact with animals
will help our children (and farm friends)
better understand the animals
and think harder about _eating_ them. 💭

### Ducks 🦆

Being water-front property,
it's _ideal_ for keeping ducks.
We've done a decent amount of research into this:
[**`#109`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/109)


### Bees 🐝 

Sadly, one person in Inês' family is allergic to bee stings,
so having a bee hive is out-of-the-question on their family-owned land.
It's a total misconception that bees sting people without good reason.
I did a bee-keeping course 
and have been around hives a lot without ever being stung.

We will 100% be installing
[**_transparent_ bee hives**](https://youtu.be/9ItlOFLTUAs) 
on _our_ land 
at the furthest edge from the main house.
There will be prominent warning signs
and we will have a first aid station
with the necessary treatment options.

#### Organic Honey 🍯 and Wax 🕯️

For maximizing crop yields keeping bees is a no-brainer.
And since most of us also like honey, 
and there will be plenty of wax,
we will have two _useful_ and "free" byproducts.

There are _many_ applications for both honey and wax
that aren't consuming it in tea or making candles.
See: 
[**`#89`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/89#issuecomment-1239227456)

### Aquaponics 🐟 + 🌱

We plan to build our own water tanks at the highest point 
on the land to store water for gravity-fed irrigation. 
In those tanks we will place several species of fish.
The fish will eat organic feed and bugs.
Their waste, full of nitrates will be used to irrigate the trees/vines.

## Energy / Power

The land is already connected to the grid for electricity.
Since it has been used for agriculture, 
the tariff is considerably lower than urban per KW/h.

### Solar Panels

Much like we have in our Braga House:
[**`home#20`**](https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/20)
We will install enough solar panels
on the property to meet _all_ our energy needs.

In addition to the solar panels,
inverter and other circuitry, 
we will buy 
enough 
[**`LiFePO4`** batteries](https://github.com/dwyl/tiny-house/issues/31)
to run all our essential appliances.

If battery storage is prohibitively expensive
because of global supply chain restrictions,
we have a _backup_-backup option.

### Pumped-storage Hydroelectricity ⚡

We plan to build a large water tank that 
can be used for pumped storage hydro,
see: 
[**`#124`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/124)
With unlimited water from the river
and excess energy from Solar Panels,
we can have energy when it's dark.


<br />

# Relevant Reading + Research 🔍

One of the obvious considerations/concerns 

## Hospital 🏥

The nearest hospital with full-service 
(Radiology, Operating Theatre, etc.)
is **`23km`** away. 
The estimated journey time is 
**`28 minutes`**:

<img width="417" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/188856534-7aa455e7-0c95-4977-b136-62b8928e21d7.png">

In an emergency we would drive our 
[TimeMachine]() 
and cut this journey time down while having safety in-mind.

Coincidentally,
when we visited the land,
a local ambulance drove past.
We see this as reassuring
that the land is accessible
to emergency services.


### On-site First Aid Center ⚕️

We will do everything we can to minimize risk to health & safety,
by having well-defined systems,
but we know accidents happen 
and they need to be addressed swiftly.
Having a dedicated first aid center (adjoining the reception)
at the entrance/exit of the property will be a high priority.

All staff will be first-aid trained
and we will have well-defined
protocols for how to triage, log and escalate injuries.-


## Douro Cruises

There is _thriving_ river cruise, vinyard tour and culinary experience tourism industry in the Douro area:
https://www.cruzeiros-douro.pt
<img width="1112" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/188457987-19ba54ba-58b2-4f0c-b507-f48bef9d6043.png">

## _Existing_ Local Guest Houses

There are already 15 guest houses

The _cheapest_ option in the area
is **`€120/night`** for 2 adults and 1 child:
**Solar Guesthouse Olival da Vinha**: https://www.booking.com/hotel/pt/solar-guest-house-olival-da-vinha.en-gb.html

It has nice decor and a good location 
**`400m`** from the centre of Castelo de Paiva.
But it's quite far from the river (no access), 
doesn't have a pool or other amenities.

This is the view from the guest house:

A bit "meh" IMO ...

Then they have a bunch of pictures of the surrounding area:

Again, we think this is a _really_ good sign.
It shows that there is demand at the higher price point.



## Comparable Property in the Area

Through our _extensive_ research we determined
that the Souselo land we are considering
with its' 
**4 ruins** to rebuild, 
**_navegable_ river access**,
virtually **_perfect_ sun exposure**,x§
existing access to mains [EDP] electricity & telecoms
and _prepared_ terraced land
is a great deal at **`€270k`**!

We captured a _subset_ of our research in:

### Luxury Modern House on `1ha` No River Access; `850k €`

This listing for a **`1ha`** piece of land 
with a **modern** designed **`152.9m²`** house 
with **_small_ pool** (zero child protection!)
_without_ river access, but with a good view of the river.
It is _further_ from the city of Porto and `OPO` airport
and yet is on the market for `850k €`.

Point is this: the _luxury_ "second home" market appears to be alive and well.
So our _worst_ case scenario with the Souselo land is:
1. Transform the main building into a luxury weekend house with: 
   + infinity pool overlooking the land
   + indoor-outdoor alfresco kitchen
     [**`#129`**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/129)
   + Covered parking spaces for 4 cars with solar panels and electric chargers ⚡
2. Prepare the land for "leisure" activities including: 
   + mini football field with high quality lawn, goal posts and painted lines ⚽
   + **`private`** river beach 🏖️
   + small boat dock with electricity for speed boats 🚤
3. Develop the smaller ruins as guest cottages for friends & family 🏡
3. Market it to absurdly overpaid **`FCP`** footballers 
   who want privacy and a spot in the fresh air for their families.

With this "business plan" I feel we can spend **`€300k`** on the development
and sell it on for north of **`€1M`** for a **`€400k` profit**. 💰

Again, I consider this the "last resort" option. 
But whenever we consider a potential investment,
we need to know what the fallback is.
