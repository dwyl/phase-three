# Douro Riverside Family Farm

After _years_ of searching 
we think we have found pretty _amazing_ spot.
It might not be our "forever" land,
but it ticks all the boxes 
to build our vision.

Extended discussion of the land is contained in the issue thread:
[#116](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-three/issues/116)



## _Golden_

The word **douro** translates to ***golden***:

We think it's a fitting name for the area;
it really is golden. üòç <br />
Gold bullion [coins, bars, etc.]
is widely regarded as a safe store of wealth.
Land similarly has not been know to _devalue_ over time. 
However, unlike **gold** that we cannot _eat_
if we're hungry,
fertile land 
with abundant water
and sunshine
_can_ produce food
we can eat 
for the rest of our lives.
I would argue that the ROI on land 
is _considerably_ better than Gold
as it has an "annual dividend" of fresh produce
while still benefiting from capital appreciation.
