# Goal

The goal is to live in _nature_ with our loved ones, fresh air, water & sunshine.
An inspiring and stimulating environment with interesting people and engaging activities.

Requirements:
+ Fertile land: https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/3 ***and/or*** https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/25

to walk hills, though we can have [_solar-powered_](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/7)
electric scooters/carts for the steeper bits,
and having an incline makes building terraced houses/growing a thing.

+ waste hight raised gardens
+ definately allow pets
+ exercise coach (at least twice a week)
+ handcrafts person (painting, embroidery, puzzle making ... mental/motor skills)
